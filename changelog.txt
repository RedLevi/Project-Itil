Hotfix 0.1.2:

Extensive work on Soviet localisation, especially events - it should all be there now
The Five Year Plan final focus will no longer bypass and so the idea should now go away

Localisation fixes in the Germany tree and the England tree
The Russian state has been slightly buffed

Peace conference AI has been vastly improved
Minor popularity and ruling party tweaks for both Sweden and Norway

Hotfix 0.1.1:

A slight error in the French events has been fixed, meaning all the events actually work now

Sweden is no longer 'Sweeden' in the Germany tree
The Soviets have some focuses and ideas on the game menu

The Soviets have ministers to fill all their slots now
Yugoslavia no longer has cores on territory it conquered during the Austrian Civil War. This will be properly addressed with the focus tree next release
Netherlands now has the name Netherlands rather than The Netherlands
