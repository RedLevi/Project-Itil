ame.1.t: "Arranging a border incident?"
ame.1.d:0 "Some senior ranking generals have approached us with a most intriuging suggestion - engineering a border incident with the federal troops along the demilitarized zone and blame it on our enemies! If we manage to provoke the Federal armies into retaliation we could finally liberate the pacific states!"
ame.1.a:0 "Brilliant suggestion! Get to it!"
ame.1.b:0 "We are not ready for war yet"
ame.2.t:0 "Tensions at the border"
ame.2.d:0 "A border skirmish turned into a full-scale battle yesterday when troops loyal to the Americanist regieme have opened fire on a guard station outside the demilitarized zone. The American regieme is already blaming us for the incident. Failing to adress this transgression would be seen as a weakness of our regieme. Should we retaliate?"
ame.2.a:0 "This will not stand! To war!"
ame.2.b:0 "We must turn the other cheek..."
ame.3.t:0 "War in America"
ame.3.d:0 "Tensions along the American demilitarized border have finally erupted today when a border skirmish broke the fragile ceasefire between the two regiems. Both sides are blaming each other for the incident, and are mobilizing for total war. Will the Federal government be able to hold back against the Americanist armies?"
ame.3.a:0 "War never changes"
ame.4.t:0 "Federalists go to war!"
ame.4.d:0 "The Federalists have fallen to our trap and have launched their counter attack against our forces on the border! This effectively means the ceasefire between us is broken and we can finally retake the western states!"
ame.4.a:0 "Just as planned!"
ame.5.t:0 "The Federalists cower!"
ame.5.d:0 "The border operation went as planned but the Federalist cowards in Sacremento did not react to our attacks! This act of cowardice is yet another indication of the weakness of their decedant regieme!"
ame.5.a:0 "Hah! Cowards!"
ame.6.t:0 "Frictions within the state apparatus"
ame.6.d:0 "While the nation settles into an uneasy ceasefire the various factions and groups who took part in the establishment of our regime begin to vi for control over the country's future.

ame.6.a:0 "Lets avoid another civil war"
ame.7.t:0 "The American Military Central Command"
ame.7.d:0 "The American Military Central Command is the central authority of all branches of the American State's military. It is made up of units loyal to the command of George Van Horn Moseley who participated in the Anti-Communist Defense campaign in 1933 and the ensuing war with the Federal loyalists. After the war they emerged as one of the main factions vying for control of the new state with the stated goal of turning it into a 'Military Republic' with a war-geared economy and interventionist foreign policy. Despite enjoying very little popular support the American Central Command still hold much power in America."
ame.7.a:0 "Interesting..."
ame.8.t:0 "The American Industrial Committee"
ame.8.d:0 "The American Industrial Committee is a board of American industrialists and tycoons, Henry Ford chief among them, who funded the Americanist pustch in 1933 and control much of the country's industrial sector and in charge of managing the federal government's appropriated properties. The committee has considerable influence on American politics with virtually absolute control over the country's economy, and ownership over the most widely circulated newspaper in the country, 'The Dearborn Independent'. The committee holds an anti-war, anti-regulation and pro-corporationist policy, and emphesize growth of the civilian sector and trade with Latin America."
ame.8.a:0 "Interesting..."
ame.9.t:0 "The Ku Klux Klan"
ame.9.d:0 "After a period of drop in popularity in the mid-20s the Ku Klux Klan have seen a surge in membership during the red scare of the early 30s and the civil war. The Klan have raised thousands of militiamen for the American cause and served as the new regime's cultural police force, rooting out moral dangers throughout the country. The Klan's is based mainly in the midwest with a significant following in the deep south, and despite their ideological fanaticism they often come to blows with the Party because of the latters' pan-christian ideology. The KKK is staunchly anti-catholic and favors a relatively isolationist position on foreign affairs."
ame.9.a:0 "Interesting..."
ame.10.t:0 "The American Party"
ame.10.d:0 "The American Party was founded in 1929 by William Dudley Pelley and played a crucial role in the  American restoration of 1933, with William accepting the role of President of the American State shortly thereafter. The party enjoys a wide following through all levels of society which serves as its source of power. The party promotes a pan-christian, socially conservative racialist ideology commonly referred to as 'Americanism', which it wrote into law being the American States official ideology. The party promotes an expansionist foreign policy and a corportivist economic system as well as centeralization of the state apparatus, which gained it many enemies among the other factions."
ame.10.a:0 "We must trust in the party and our president"
ame.11.t:0 "Constitutional Convention of 1936"
ame.11.d:0 "Despite most federal institutions being purged during the American Restoration, Congressmen loyal to the American cause have been allowed to keep operating as America's supreme legislative, alongside new congressmen appointed by the new electoral college. Until now congress have been busy with issues relating to the war with the federalists, but with the dust settling on the demilitarized zone, time have finally come to handle the internal structure of the state. There are several factions vying for control and its up to congress to choose the best men for the job."

ame.12.t:0 "Peace summit with the Federalists?"
ame.12.d:0 "As part of the prosperity policy heralded by Henry Ford voices within the American Industrial Committee have called for peace and trade negotiations with the Federal regieme in the west. While sure to cause discontent with the more radical sections of the political establishment it will surely help heal the country's economy and will allow our ships to finally pass through the Panama canal."
ame.12.a:0 "Arrange a summit with Sacremento"
ame.12.b:0 "No need to negotiate with the federalists"
ame.13.t:0 "Peace with the Integralists?"
ame.13.d:0 "With the pro-peace faction taking power in the usurper state to the east there have been voices within our cabinet calling for a reconcilation between our two governments. It seems like similar voices whispered in the east as we have recived a formal invitation from the American State's foreign minister to attend a peace conference. The Integralists are offering a end to hostilities between our regimes as well as a mutually beneficial trade agreement. Agreeing would surely help our economy recover from both the war and the great depression, but it is sure to anger more radical voices in the public. What should we do?"
ame.13.a:0 "Sign the treaty!"
ame.13.b:0 "No normalization of the usurper regieme!"
ame.14.t:0 "Peace with the Federalists!"

ame.14.a:0 "Fantastic!"
ame.15.t:0 "The Federalists refuse!"
ame.15.d:0 "The Federal government in Sacremento have declined the terms of our peace offer! It seems like peaceful reconstruction of the country will be more difficult than we had hoped!"
ame.15.a:0 "Fools!"
ame.16.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.16.d:0 ""..and to maintain and protect the nation's purity and stability it is paramount that the centeralization and solification of all state offices under the party and the president would commence at once... " The new constitution drafted by the congress gives absolute executive and judicial powers as well as the privlige of appointing electors to the American Party. All branches of the state, including all state industries and the military are now subject to the will of the Party and our glorious leader, William Dudley Pelley. United, the American State shall march into the future."
ame.16.a:0 "Praise Pelley!"
ame.17.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.17.d:0 ""...the integrity of the moral fiber of our nation stands paramount in our interests, calling for the expulsion of all foreign poisions threatening our race from this great land of ours..." The new constitution drafted by the congress effectively gives the various semi-state sanctioned paramilitary organizations operating in the country, the Ku Klux Klan chief among them, full integration into the highest positions of power in the state. The Klan have already began its crusade against the moral dangers and degenerates threatening the nation."
ame.17.a:0 "The rebirth of the nation!"
ame.18.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.18.d:0 ""...The defense of our succsesful restoration and the expansion of our ideals can only be achieved by military might and military control, and from here on all actions of the state are to be directed as such..."

ame.18.a:0 "This We'll Defend"
ame.19.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.19.d:0 ""...It is of undeniable truth that the nation is best lead by those with the highest incentive for its prosperity and with the greatest experience and skill in leading..." The new constitution drafted by the congress empowers the Industrial Committee well above the other offices of state and essentially grants the board of directors position greater in power than the president itself. Already buisnesses throughout the country have been redistributed to the committee's most expirienced members' management."
ame.19.a:0 "We will make America great again"
