ame.1.t: "Arranging a border incident?"
ame.1.d:0 "Some senior ranking generals have approached us with a most intriuging suggestion - engineering a border incident with the federal troops along the demilitarized zone and blame it on our enemies! If we manage to provoke the Federal armies into retaliation we could finally liberate the pacific states!"
ame.1.a:0 "Brilliant suggestion! Get to it!"
ame.1.b:0 "We are not ready for war yet"
ame.2.t:0 "Tensions at the border"
ame.2.d:0 "A border skirmish turned into a full-scale battle yesterday when troops loyal to the Americanist regieme have opened fire on a guard station outside the demilitarized zone.

ame.2.b:0 "We must turn the other cheek..."
ame.3.t:0 "War in America"

ame.3.a:0 "War never changes"
ame.4.t:0 "Federalists go to war!"
ame.4.d:0 "The Federalists have fallen to our trap and have launched their counter attack against our forces on the border! This effectively means the ceasefire between us is broken and we can finally retake the western states!"
ame.4.a:0 "Just as planned!"
ame.5.t:0 "The Federalists cower!"
ame.5.d:0 "The border operation went as planned but the Federalist cowards in Sacremento did not react to our attacks! This act of cowardice is yet another indication of the weakness of their decedant regieme!"

ame.6.t:0 "Frictions within the state apparatus"
ame.6.d:0 "While the nation settles into an uneasy ceasefire the various factions and groups who took part in the establishment of our regime begin to vi for control over the country's future.

ame.7.t:0 "The American Military Central Command"
ame.7.d:0 "The American Military Central Command is the central authority of all branches of the American State's military. It is made up of units loyal to the command of George Van Horn Moseley who participated in the Anti-Communist Defense campaign in 1933 and the ensuing war with the Federal loyalists. After the war they emerged as one of the main factions vying for control of the new state with the stated goal of turning it into a 'Military Republic' with a war-geared economy and interventionist foreign policy.

The committee has considerable influence on American politics with virtually absolute control over the country's economy, and ownership over the most widely circulated newspaper in the country, 'The Dearborn Independent'.

The Klan have raised thousands of militiamen for the American cause and served as the new regime's cultural police force, rooting out moral dangers throughout the country. The Klan's is based mainly in the midwest with a significant following in the deep south, and despite their ideological fanaticism they often come to blows with the Party because of the latters' pan-christian ideology. The KKK is staunchly anti-catholic and favors a relatively isolationist position on foreign affairs and is ardently pushing for the introduction of a system of unfree labor as a way to reinvigurate the economy."

The party promotes a pan-christian, socially conservative racialist ideology commonly referred to as 'Americanism', which it wrote into law being the American States official ideology.

It seems like similar voices whispered in the east as we have recived a formal invitation from the American State's foreign minister to attend a peace conference. The Integralists are offering a end to hostilities between our regimes as well as a mutually beneficial trade agreement. Agreeing would surely help our economy recover from both the war and the great depression, but it is sure to anger more radical voices in the public. What should we do?"

ame.16.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.16.d:0 ""..and to maintain and protect the nation's purity and stability it is paramount that the centeralization and solification of all state offices under the party and the president would commence at once... " The new constitution drafted by the congress gives absolute executive and judicial powers as well as the privlige of appointing electors to the American Party.

ame.16.a:0 "Praise Pelley!"
ame.17.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.17.d:0 ""...the integrity of the moral fiber of our nation stands paramount in our interests, calling for the expulsion of all foreign poisions threatening our race from this great land of ours..." The new constitution drafted by the congress effectively gives the various semi-state sanctioned paramilitary organizations operating in the country, the Ku Klux Klan chief among them, full integration into the highest positions of power in the state. The Klan have already began its crusade against the moral dangers and degenerates threatening the nation."
ame.17.a:0 "The rebirth of the nation!"

ame.19.t:0 "The constitution of the American State"
ame.19.d:0 ""...It is of undeniable truth that the nation is best lead by those with the highest incentive for its prosperity and with the greatest experience and skill in leading..." The new constitution drafted by the congress empowers the Industrial Committee well above the other offices of state and essentially grants the board of directors position greater in power than the president itself. Already buisnesses throughout the country have been redistributed to the committee's most expirienced members' management."
