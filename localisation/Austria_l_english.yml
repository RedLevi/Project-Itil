aus.1.t:0 "The Reconquest of Hungary"
aus.1.d:0 "Many years have passed since the loss of our rightful imperial territory during the bloody civil war. Now is the time to put the Hungarians back in their place and reclaim Hungary for ourselves! Our troops are ready, our factories are pouring out guns and muntions, the people are behind our cause and the Hungarians are not expecting an attack. However, one question remains - shall we seek support from our German allies - at the risk the demand we back down or even favour Hungary, or shall we declare here and now?"
aus.1.a:0 "Declare War Immediately!"
aus.1.b:0 "Secretly ask the Germans for their help"
aus.1.c:0 "Back down"
aus.2.t:0 "Austria declares war!"
aus.2.d:0 "Austria once again threatens our independence with their armed forces. Their amries have swiftly mobalised on our borders, and skirmishes have already broken out between our forces and theirs. We must defend out homeland to the last!"
aus.2.a:0 "To Arms!"
aus.3.t:0 "Austria takes Inititive!"
aus.3.d:0 "The remnants of the shattered empire Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria, has taken up arms today to reconquer their lost imperial territory of Hungary. Austria has long been a faithful ally of Germany, and so there is widepspread support of the war, both from the public and from key members of the Imperial Governmnet. The restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire would ensure a powerful ally for Germany once more, especially in the growingly dark times upon us. With Hungary restored to Imperial authority, the way to total reconquest may lay open for us to exploit hand in hand with our ally. \nHowever, questions have been raised as to the Austrian ability to reconquer Hungary on their own. Shall we provide them with some arms and men, or can they handle themselves. Or, more drastically, shall we demand they end this conflict and consolodate what little they have left before thinking of taking back what may not be theirs?"
aus.3.a:0 "Send Austria some Men and Guns"
aus.3.b:0 "They can handle themselves!"
aus.3.c:0 "Maybe we should wait this out..."
aus.3.d:0 "Demand Austria reconsider!"
aus.4.t:0 "The Austrian Reconquest of Hungary"
aus.4.d:0 "Last week, Austria declared war on Hungary, citing 'reconquest' as their Casus Belli. Unfortunatley, this isn't the late middle ages, and their actions have global consiquence. Austrian troops violated the Hungarian border at 8:11am that morning, striking a number of Hungarian army positions. Since then full on warfare has developed between the two powers. Our intelligence service reports that Germany, ever the close ally of Austria and willing to see a restoration of the empire, has yet to react to the war on their doorsetp, but we anticipate that there is an 80% chance they will send armed aid to the Austrians. \nThe question being raised in our Parliment today, however, is what to do. Many would like to see us send our own aid to Hungary. However, there are sone more extreme views in the chamber - some favour leaving Hungary to its fate and avoiding a possible war, whilst others wish for us to send an ultimatum to Austria to force them to back down."

Since then full on warfare has developed between the two powers. Our intelligence service reports that Germany has decided to remain impartial in the conflict - they clearly have not decided which horse to back yet. \nThe question being raised in our Parliment today, however, is what to do.

aus.4.d_ultimatum:0 "Last week, Austria declared war on Hungary. Austrian troops violated the Hungarian border at 8:11am that morning, striking a number of Hungarian army positions. Since then full on warfare has developed between the two powers. We have, however, recieved a somewhat baffling report from our intelligence service, which details Germany has decided to issue an ultimatum to the Austrians and demand the status-quo be maintained. \nThe question being raised in our Parliment today, however, is what to do. Many would like to see us send our own aid to Hungary. However, there are sone more extreme views in the chamber - some favour leaving Hungary to its fate (and the apparent defence of Germany), whilst others wish for us to send an ultimatum of our own to Austria to force them to back down. For the first time in years, there would be unanimous support from Germany and Britain for a swift end to the war."
aus.4.a:0 "We must issue an ultimatum to Austria to cease this conflict!"
aus.4.b:0 "Send Hungary some men and supplies"
aus.4.c:0 "This is not our problem"
aus.5.t:0 "Austria invades Hungary!"
aus.5.d:0 "About two weeks ago we began reciving unverified reports of a conflict on the Austro-Hungarian border. The fighting came to a fore and war was declared later that day by Austria. They claim to be merely reclaiming terriory held by a rebellious, illegal state. The reaction from Germany and the United Kingdom is still mixed and unclear, but our analysists anticipate German support for Austria in the form of arms and weapons, and similar British support for Hungary. \n This leaves us with an interesting oppertunity. Both belligerants in the war hold land we consider our own - Slovenia, part of Austria, and the southern part of Hungary. We could choose to issue an ultimatum to one of the belligerants for the land rightfully ours - chances are they will accept over risking a war on two fronts."
aus.5.a:0 "Send an Ultimatum to Austria"
aus.5.b:0 "Send an Ultimatum to Hungary"
aus.5.c:0 "We can't risk war right now."

aus.7.t:0 "Germany Demands Peace!"
aus.7.d:0 "This morning we recieved the most bizare message from the German mission in Austria. After reciting the benefits we gain from being part of Germany's alliance, the Germans has the audacity to demand that we must sign an immediate white peace with Hungary! They seem to claim a variety of reasons, ranging from the possibility of British support for Hungary, to an uprising of the Slovenians in our southern lands. We obviously think this is preposturous - the Germans must have some other motive to attempting to reigning us in. However, it means we stand at a crossroads - we either continue with our righteous fight against the Hungarians and begin the restoration of our Empire, or we resign ourselves to a future with the Germans of consolodation what we own. History will change this day, for better or worse."
aus.7.a:0 "We fight on, with or without the Germans!"
aus.7.b:0 "With heavy hears, we must obey"
aus.8.t:0 "Austria Responds"
aus.8.d:0 "Today the German mission to Austria recieved a response. The Austrians, fools that they are, have decided to not heed our gental perusations and instead have decided to press on in their war with Hungary! They clearly have no respect for us - their old allies and closest friends in this cruel, cruel world. \nNow we must face the tough decision - have they called our bluff, and we let them continue with this foolish war,  or shall we remove them from our defensive pact. Even worse, shall we economically sanction them? Or, as the most extreme measure, do we enter in talks with Hungary over an alliance, with them resotring dual-power instead of the idiots that sit in the Austrian court?"
aus.8.a:0 "They have called our bluff"
aus.8.b:0 "Only go as far as removing them from the defence pact"
aus.8.c:0 "Remove Austria from the alliance and economically sanction them"
aus.8.e:0 "Sanction Austria and enter alliance discussions with Hungary"
aus.9.t:0 "Germany takes measures against Austria!"
aus.9.d_removed:0 "We are recieving yet more unconformed reports that Germany has removed Austria from their defensive pact. Whilst neither side is willing to comment, a German press conference scheduled for tomorrow will likely confirm what we expect. The reasoning behind this sudden move is also likely the result of Austria agression against Hungary. However, this move is thoroughly supprising - Germany is the closest, if only, ally of Austria - this move will leave them severly weaken the Austrians - and possibly even lead to a Yugoslavian move on the southern boder."
aus.9.d_sanctioned:0 "We are recieving yet more unconformed reports that Germany has removed Austria from their defensive pact and that Germany has economically sanctioned Austria.

aus.9.a:0 "It was the right move"
aus.9.b:0 "They tear themselves apart"
aus.9.c:0 "We must weigh our response"
aus.9.e:0 "Germany may be our friend once again"
aus.8.f:0 "Looks like Austria may be on the menu..."
aus.9.g:0 "The Balkans was a powerkeg enough without German intervention"
aus.10.t:0 "Germany has sanctioned us!"
aus.10.d:0 "Not content with merely scaring us into submition, the Germans have decided to one-up themselves and economically sanction us. Not only that, but they have removed us from their alliance! We now, in name at least, stand completely alone and vunerable - especially to Yugoslavian agression on the souther border. A poor timing indeed, considering Yougoslavian garrison troops on the border are in the midst of military exercises. The Germans have informed us that the sanctions will come in to place in a week if we do not agree to sign peace. The decision is now."
aus.10.a:0 "This is too much - we must give in"
aus.10.b:0 "We have made our choice, and we shall take our stand"
aus.11.t:0 "Our Economy recovers from the Austrian Sanctions"
aus.11.d:0 "A few months after our sanctions of Austria, our economy has recovered from the embargo. Our economy is what it was before the sanctions, and we have finally cut the last strings from the resources and products we imported from the Austrian region."
aus.11.a:0 "Good"
aus.12.t:0 "German mission to Hungary"
aus.12.d:0 "Yesterday, a mission from Germany arrived in the Budapest. Initially, we were suspicious of such a move from the strongest allies of our now enemies, but the mist extrodinary turn of events appears to have occured. Germany, unhappy at the aggressive action of Austria, has removed them from the defencive pact and has economically sanctioned them. Moreover, they appear to be wanting to give us all the benefits Austria previously experienced, including economic support and a defensive pact. This would certainly keep us safe from any agression - the Austrians, Romanians and Yugoslavians would not dare attack us with such protection. However, it would mean entering the sphere of Germany - and possibly being called to arms if another European war broke out. Moreover, they wish that we restore dual-power, with their military assistance, over Austria and Bohemia - we must think carefully about whether or not we wish to accept this stipulation, considering it is exactly what we fought the civil to be rid off."
aus.12.a:0 "Accept entirely"
aus.12.b:0 "We will take help but not land"
aus.12.c:0 "The Germans will never lord over us"
aus.13.t:0 "No Allies in the Balkans"
aus.13.d:0 "Our mission to the Hungarians has yielded no results. They stubbornly refuse to be lorded over by us, citing that they do not wish to just be the puppet Austria once was. As such, we are left completely without allies in the Balkans, having left Austria and had no positive response from Hungary. \nUndoubtably a new crisies will arrise in the Balkan Powerkeg, but until that day the Yugoslavians will grow bold and the British will gain significant influence on our southern front."
aus.13.a:0 "We may have played this wrong..."
