aus.1.t:0 "The Reconquest of Hungary"
aus.1.d:0 "Many years have passed since the loss of our rightful imperial territory during the bloody civil war. Now is the time to put the Hungarians back in their place and reclaim Hungary for ourselves! Our troops are ready, our factories are pouring out guns and muntions, the people are behind our cause and the Hungarians are not expecting an attack. However, one question remains - shall we seek support from our German allies - at the risk the demand we back down or even favour Hungary, or shall we declare here and now?"
aus.1.a:0 "Declare War Immediately!"
aus.1.b:0 "Secretly ask the Germans for their help"
aus.1.c:0 "Back down"
aus.2.t:0 "Austria declares war!"
aus.2.d:0 "Austria once again threatens our independence with their armed forces. Their amries have swiftly mobalised on our borders, and skirmishes have already broken out between our forces and theirs. We must defend out homeland to the last!"
aus.2.a:0 "To Arms!"
aus.3.t:0 "Austria takes Inititive!"
aus.3.d:0 "The remnants of the shattered empire Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria, has taken up arms today to reconquer their lost imperial territory of Hungary. Austria has long been a faithful ally of Germany, and so there is widepspread support of the war, both from the public and from key members of the Imperial Governmnet. The restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire would ensure a powerful ally for Germany once more, especially in the growingly dark times upon us. With Hungary restored to Imperial authority, the way to total reconquest may lay open for us to exploit hand in hand with our ally. \nHowever, questions have been raised as to the Austrian ability to reconquer Hungary on their own. Shall we provide them with some arms and men, or can they handle themselves. Or, more drastically, shall we demand they end this conflict and consolodate what little they have left before thinking of taking back what may not be theirs?"
aus.3.a:0 "Send Austria some Men and Guns"
aus.3.b:0 "They can handle themselves!"
aus.3.c:0 "Maybe we should wait this out..."
aus.3.d:0 "Demand Austria reconsider!"
aus.4.t:0 "The Austrian Reconquest of Hungary"
aus.4.d:0 "Last week, Austria declared war on Hungary, citing 'reconquest' as their Casus Belli. Unfortunatley, this isn't the late middle ages, and their actions have global consiquence. Austrian troops violated the Hungarian border at 8:11am that morning, striking a number of Hungarian army positions. Since then full on warfare has developed between the two powers. Our intelligence service reports that Germany, ever the close ally of Austria and willing to see a restoration of the empire, has yet to react to the war on their doorsetp, but we anticipate that there is an 80% chance they will send armed aid to the Austrians. \nThe question being raised in our Parliment today, however, is what to do. Many would like to see us send our own aid to Hungary. However, there are sone more extreme views in the chamber - some favour leaving Hungary to its fate and avoiding a possible war, whilst others wish for us to send an ultimatum to Austria to force them to back down."

Since then full on warfare has developed between the two powers.

aus.4.d_ultimatum:0 "Last week, Austria declared war on Hungary. Austrian troops violated the Hungarian border at 8:11am that morning, striking a number of Hungarian army positions. Since then full on warfare has developed between the two powers. We have, however, recieved a somewhat baffling report from our intelligence service, which details Germany has decided to issue an ultimatum to the Austrians and demand the status-quo be maintained. \nThe question being raised in our Parliment today, however, is what to do. Many would like to see us send our own aid to Hungary. However, there are sone more extreme views in the chamber - some favour leaving Hungary to its fate (and the apparent defence of Germany), whilst others wish for us to send an ultimatum of our own to Austria to force them to back down. For the first time in years, there would be unanimous support from Germany and Britain for a swift end to the war."
aus.4.a:0 "We must issue an ultimatum to Austria to cease this conflict!"
aus.4.b:0 "Send Hungary some men and supplies"
aus.4.c:0 "This is not our problem"
aus.5.t:0 "Austria invades Hungary!"
aus.5.d:0 "About two weeks ago we began reciving unverified reports of a conflict on the Austro-Hungarian border. The fighting came to a fore and war was declared later that day by Austria. They claim to be merely reclaiming terriory held by a rebellious, illegal state. The reaction from Germany and the United Kingdom is still mixed and unclear, but our analysists anticipate German support for Austria in the form of arms and weapons, and similar British support for Hungary. \n This leaves us with an interesting oppertunity. Both belligerants in the war hold land we consider our own - Slovenia, part of Austria, and the southern part of Hungary. We could choose to issue an ultimatum to one of the belligerants for the land rightfully ours - chances are they will accept over risking a war on two fronts."
