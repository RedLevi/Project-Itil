 france.1.t:0 "The state of France"
 france.1.d:0 "The catastrophe that was the great war have left the country weak, devestated and humiliated. Dozens of governments rose and fell since, each failing to restore both food to the people's plates and pride to their hearts. Under the national unity government of 1928 have managed to bring some improvment, only to be cruelly beat down by the world economic crisis. The political instability have radicalized the french people, both to the left and the right, and everyone can feel the result of the 1936 elections would radically transform French society. On the left, the French Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party have formed the French Popular Front with the aim of establishing a left wing state in France, and they are supported by the CGT-UAC labor alliance. On the right, the ruling French Republican Party have formed the anti-socialist National Front with the National Integralist French Popular Leauge. Many reactionary army generals have expressed their open support of the National Front. The streets are tense with hostility and occasional cases of violence between supporters of either faction."

 france.2.t:0 "The Right Wing"
 france.2.d:0 "The National Front was established as a right wing bulwark against the growing socialist movement , with the relatively new French Popular Leauge joining in with the French Republican Party. There is very little ideological overlap between the new parties, with the French Popular leauge seeking to establish a new order in France based on National-Syndicalist lines according to the teachings of Sorel, with many in the Republican Party decrying the alliance as a betrayel of democracy. Despite these protests, the alliance recieves a wide support from the middle and upper classes, as well as many military officers, including the minister of war Philippe PÃ©tain."
