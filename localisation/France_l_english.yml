france.1.t:0 "The state of France"
france.1.d:0 "The catastrophe that was the great war have left the country weak, devestated and humiliated. Dozens of governments rose and fell since, each failing to restore both food to the people's plates and pride to their hearts. Under the national unity government of 1928 have managed to bring some improvment, only to be cruelly beat down by the world economic crisis. The political instability have radicalized the french people, both to the left and the right, and everyone can feel the result of the 1936 elections would radically transform French society. On the left, the French Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party have formed the French Popular Front with the aim of establishing a left wing state in France, and they are supported by the CGT-UAC labor alliance. On the right, the ruling French Republican Party have formed the anti-socialist National Front with the National Integralist French Popular Leauge. Many reactionary army generals have expressed their open support of the National Front. The streets are tense with hostility and occasional cases of violence between supporters of either faction."
france.1.a:0 "How Unfortunate"
france.2.t:0 "The National Front"
france.2.d:0 "The National Front was established as a right wing bulwark against the growing socialist movement , with the relatively new French Popular Leauge joining in with the well established monarchist Action Française. There is some ideological overlap between the new parties, with the French Popular leauge seeking to establish a new order in France based on National-Syndicalist lines according to the teachings of Sorel, while the Action Française seeking to reestablish the monarchy. Despite these differences, the alliance recieves a wide support from the middle and upper classes, as well as many military officers, including the minister of war Philippe Pétain."
france.2.a:0 "Okay"
france.3.t:0 "The People's Front"
france.3.d:0 "The French People's Front is a coalition of Socialist Party and the Republican Party which hopes to perserve democracy and freedom in France. There are major differences within the front, with the Socialist Party advocating for a Marxist platform and the establishment of a fourth republic, and the Republican Party wishes to retain the current model. The movement plans to contend in the 1936 elections, where it is predicted they will attract a big percentage of the electorate. The radical Anarchist-Syndicalist alliance, the CGT-UAC have also endorsed the movement."
france.3.a:0 "Okay"
france.4.t:0 "General elections of 1936"
france.4.d:0 "Tensions in the streets are high as the French people go out to decide the future of the country in the general elections today. Popular opinion is divided with close to a 50% split between the National Front and the people's front. There have been numerous cases of violence breaking out across the country with both far right and far left groups clashing over the upcoming vote. Several high ranking generals, with Philippe Petain being most notabe have expressed their intent to stabiize the situation by force if escelation continues."

Right wing militants belonging to the Popular leauge and  Action Française storming government buildings throughout the country. General Philippe Petain and his cronies have publically announced their support of the rebels and their "fight against anarchism in France" taking much of the armed forces with them. The remaining loyalist troops have been split between officers loyal to the socialist party and the republican party, with militias and volunteers making up the bulk of the government's fighting force. Additionally the CGT-UAC union have declared a general strike in Savoy and raised its own militias with the support of the Italian government, and have so far formally accepted the rule of the coalition. It appears as our worst fears have come to pass and we are now faced with a civil war."

france.8.d:0 "After months of fighting, the homeland stands destroyed and blood of countless thousands shed. This has truly been a dark age for France, but a bright future is ahead now with the reactionaries and counter revolutionaries slain. Yet, there are still enemies to be taken care of. The initial conditions stated that once the rebels are destroyed, the republic will revert back to normal. But Souvarine and many elements within the socialist party argue that the CGT-UAC and the Republicans will be only a nuisance to the success of the new French republic, while the others argue that this will be solved by democratic and diplomatic means. Simply attacking these dissidents can give us much greater freedom to enact our policies, but at a high cost..."
