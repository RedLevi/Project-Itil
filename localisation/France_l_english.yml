france_torn_desc:0 "Dissent and despair are affecting the French nation out of many factors and as now, the French Republic is under threat of both of the radical Right and Left-wing politics. The elections are soon coming and our nation in chaos so the future doesn't seem bright."

###EVENTS###
france.1.t:0 "The state of France"
france.1.d:0 "The catastrophe that was the great war have left the country weak, devestated and humiliated. Dozens of governments rose and fell since, each failing to restore both food to the people's plates and pride to their hearts. Under the national unity government of 1928 have managed to bring some improvment, only to be cruelly beat down by the world economic crisis. The political instability have radicalized the french people, both to the left and the right, and everyone can feel the result of the 1936 elections would radically transform French society. On the left, the French Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party have formed the French Popular Front with the aim of establishing a left wing state in France, and they are supported by the CGT-UAC labor alliance. On the right, the ruling French Republican Party have formed the anti-socialist National Front with the National Integralist French Popular Leauge. Many reactionary army generals have expressed their open support of the National Front. The streets are tense with hostility and occasional cases of violence between supporters of either faction."
france.1.a:0 "How Unfortunate"
france.2.t:0 "The National Front"
france.2.d:0 "The National Front was established as a right wing bulwark against the growing socialist movement , with the relatively new French Popular Leauge joining in with the well established monarchist Action Française. There is some ideological overlap between the new parties, with the French Popular leauge seeking to establish a new order in France based on National-Syndicalist lines according to the teachings of Sorel, while the Action Française seeking to reestablish the monarchy. Despite these differences, the alliance recieves a wide support from the middle and upper classes, as well as many military officers, including the minister of war Philippe Pétain."
france.2.a:0 "Okay"
france.3.t:0 "The People's Front"
france.3.d:0 "The French People's Front is a coalition of Socialist Party and the Republican Party which hopes to perserve democracy and freedom in France. There are major differences within the front, with the Socialist Party advocating for a Marxist platform and the establishment of a fourth republic, and the Republican Party wishes to retain the current model. The movement plans to contend in the 1936 elections, where it is predicted they will attract a big percentage of the electorate. The radical Anarchist-Syndicalist alliance, the CGT-UAC have also endorsed the movement."
france.3.a:0 "Okay"
france.4.t:0 "General elections of 1936"
france.4.d:0 "Tensions in the streets are high as the French people go out to decide the future of the country in the general elections today. Popular opinion is divided with close to a 50% split between the National Front and the people's front. There have been numerous cases of violence breaking out across the country with both far right and far left groups clashing over the upcoming vote. Several high ranking generals, with Philippe Petain being most notabe have expressed their intent to stabiize the situation by force if escelation continues."
france.4.a:0 "The French People's Front secures a majority!"
france.5.t:0 "The National Front contests elections result!"
france.5.d:0 "Following several days of unprecedented chaos across the country, the collective leadership of the national front have publicly contested the elections result and denounced our democratically elected government as a "Judeo-Soviet conspiracy". Right wing militants belonging to the Popular League  and  Action Française storming government buildings throughout the country. General Philippe Petain and his cronies have publicly announced their support of the rebels and their "fight against anarchism in France" taking much of the armed forces with them. The remaining loyalist troops have been split between officers loyal to the Socialist Party and the Republican Party, with militias and volunteers making up the bulk of the government's fighting force. Additionally the CGT-UAC union have declared a general strike in Provence and raised its own militias with the support of the Italian government, and have so far formally accepted the rule of the coalition. It appears as our worst fears have come to pass and we are now faced with a civil war."

france.5.b:0 "The motherland must be defended from Anarchism and conspirators!"
france.8.t:0 "The people victorious!"
france.8.d:0 "After months of fighting and endless bloodshed the homeland stands devestated and the blood of countless thousands shed. This has truly been a dark age for France, but a bright future is ahead now with the reactionaries and counter revolutionaries defeated. However, there are still enemies to be taken care of from within our coalition, and while we fought together so far, there is no telling what the anarchists and liberals are plotting. The party leadership is currently engaged in heated secret discussions on how to proceed..."

france.11.d:0 "After months of prolonged, devestating warfare across the country, the brave heros of the French National Front have finally liberated the country from the corrupt hands of the plutocratic socialist establishment and restored control and pride for the French nation. Despite the shared struggle, tensions erupted amidst the celebration as the various parties and organizations in our coalition have began to split along ideological lines. We stand at a delicate situation, and if we do not handle it correctly we could find ourself in another civil war!"
france.11.a:0 "Propose a unified France"
france.11.b:0 "Only room for one France!"
france.12.t:0 "A new age for France"
france.12.d:0 "Today the leaders of the Action Francasie, the Popular front and the National Salvation Front have reached an agreement over the future of France following the victory in the civil war.

Now, with all his opponents destroyed or exiled, Petain has absolute power  over the country"

france.14.t:0 "A nation divided"
france.14.d:0 "The ongoing civil war have split the country into many warring factions, each offering its own agenda for the future of  France. Even within our own alliance there are different groups vying for control."

france.16.t:0 "Petain offers a compromise"
france.16.d:0 "General Petain have approached us in a secret meeting in Brest today. He offered us to join him in creating a new government for France. While agreeing would give us only moderate influence in the future of France, refusing will surely result in open warfare between us and the NSA, a conflict  which we are unlikely to win. What should we do?"
france.16.b:0 "Together we will lead France towards a brighter future!"
france.16.a:0 "No deals with slimey snakes!"
france.17.t:0 "Petain holds a meeting"
france.17.d:0 "General Petain have invited us to a meeting in Paris to discuss the future of our alliance. Many people within our movement are calling for a cooperation with the National Salvation Front, but the inner circles of the party are worried about ideological tensions with the other members.

france.17.b:0 "Let us build a new France  together!"
france.18.t:0 "Coalition with the Socialists?"
france.18.d:0 "Following the victory in the civil war the question remains of what to do with the socialists and anarchists who now control most parts of the country. Most of the party sees an opportunity to backstab the reds and retake France for democracy and our long-held ideals of freedom, but some of the more left leaning members offer to accept the Socialists' offer of peaceful cooperation between our two blocs. What should we do?"
france.18.a:0 "We will destroy them! Better dead than red!"
france.18.b:0 "We will work with our former allies to rebuild France"
france.19.t:0 "Marxists offer cooperation"
france.19.d:0 "Union delegates affiliated with the Socialist Party of France have proposed a cooperation deal during a session of the French-Syndicalist Unions Assembly. The proposal outlines a new future for France integrating both our system and the SPF's ideology in a system similar to a more centralized version of Italy's system. While there is great support for this cooperation some of the more radical members of the assembly are worried about increased state control. Refusing the deal is likely to completely destroy our working relationship with the socialist party."

france.20.t:0 "The republic triumphant"

The Stavka has already prepared 7 divisions, along with Major General Zhukov, a hero of the 2nd Russo Japanese war."
france.28.a:0 "Send them!"
france.28.b:0 "I dont think so!"
france.30.t:0 "An offer from Germany"
france.30.d:0 "The Germans have came to us with an offer to directly intervene in the war in our favor in exchange to dropping our claims to French lands within the German empire. Should we agree to this, both or rivals and our rivals will be outraged and we're likely to go to war with the entire country. What should we do?"
