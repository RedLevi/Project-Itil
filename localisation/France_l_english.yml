france.1.t:0 "A nation in turmoil"
france.1.d:0 "The catastrophe that was the great war have left the country weak, devestated and humiliated. Dozens of ruling coalitions rose and fell since, each failing to restore both food to the people's plates and pride to their hearts. Under the national unity government of 1928 have managed to bring some improvment, only to be cruelly beat down by the world economic crisis. The political instability have radicalized the french people, both to the left and the right, and everyone can feel the result of the 1936 elections would radically transform French society. On the left, the French Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party have formed the French Popular League with the aim of establishing a left wing state in France, and they are supported by the CGT-UAC labor alliance. On the right, the ruling French Republican Party have formed the anti-socialist National Front with the National Integralist French Popular Leauge. Many reactionary army generals have expressed their open support of the National Front. The streets are tense with hostility and occasional cases of violence between supporters of either faction."
france.1.a:0 "How Unfortunate"
france.2.t:0 "The National Front"
france.2.d:0 "The National Front was established as a right wing bulwark against the growing socialist movement , with the relatively new French Popular Leauge joining in with the well established monarchist Action Française. There is some ideological overlap between the new parties, with the French Popular leauge seeking to establish a new order in France based on National-Syndicalist lines according to the teachings of Sorel, while the Action Française seeking to reestablish the monarchy. Despite these differences, the alliance recieves a wide support from the middle and upper classes, as well as many military officers, including the minister of war Philippe Pétain."

There are major differences within the front, with the Socialist Party advocating for a Marxist platform and the establishment of a fourth republic, and the Republican Party wishes to retain the current model. The movement plans to contend in the 1936 elections, where it is predicted they will attract a big percentage of the electorate. The radical Anarchist-Syndicalist alliance, the radical CGT-UAC labor union has also endorsed the movement."
france.3.a:0 "Okay"
france.4.t:0 "General elections of 1936"
france.4.d:0 "Tensions in the streets are high as the French people go out to decide the future of the country in the general elections today. Popular opinion is divided with close to a 50% split between the National Front and the people's front. There have been numerous cases of violence breaking out across the country with both far right and far left groups clashing over the upcoming vote. Several high ranking generals, with Philippe Petain being most notabe have expressed their intent to stabiize the situation by force if escelation continues."

Right wing militants belonging to the Popular League  and  Action Française storming government buildings throughout the country. General Philippe Petain and his cronies have publicly announced their support of the rebels and their "fight against anarchism in France" taking much of the armed forces with them. The remaining loyalist troops have been split between officers loyal to the Socialist Party and the Republican Party, with militias and volunteers making up the bulk of the government's fighting force. Additionally the CGT-UAC union have declared a general strike in Provence and raised its own militias with the support of the Italian government, and have so far formally accepted the rule of the coalition. It appears as our worst fears have come to pass and we are now faced with a civil war."

However, there are still enemies to be taken care of from within our coalition, and while we fought together so far, there is no telling what the anarchists and liberals are plotting. The party leadership is currently engaged in heated secret discussions on how to proceed..."

france.14.t:0 "Intervate in the French Civil War?"
france.14.d:0 "The ongoing civil war have split the French nation into many warring factions, each offering its own agenda for the future of  France. It is known the Syndicalist faction within the Communist bloc has our full support. If we intervate and use our military force, the Germans may come on us, and this can lead into another world conflict, or should we make discreet appoarch and support them only by aid?"

france.14.b:0 "Send military aid only."
france.15.t:0 "Italian Syndicalist Military Intervention"
france.15.d:0 "The bloodthirsty Syndies in Italy have decided to take arms against the anti-communists. This makes the chance for the anti-communist faction to win few, and in the long term it would come and avenge us, what shall we do?"
france.15.a:0 "Warn the Italians, this will be their end!"
france.15.b:0 "Perhaps we should still stay aside."
france.16.t:0 "Petain offers a compromise"
france.16.d:0 "General Petain have approached us in a secret meeting in Brest today. He offered us to join him in creating a new government for France. While agreeing would give us only moderate influence in the future of France, refusing will surely result in open warfare between us and the NSA, a conflict  which we are unlikely to win. What should we do?"

france.18.t:0 "Coalition with the Socialists?"
france.18.d:0 "Following the victory in the civil war the question remains of what to do with the socialists and anarchists who now control most parts of the country. Most of the party sees an opportunity to backstab the reds and retake France for democracy and our long-held ideals of freedom, but some of the more left leaning members offer to accept the Socialists' offer of peaceful cooperation between our two blocs. What should we do?"
france.18.a:0 "We will destroy them! Better dead than red!"
france.18.b:0 "We will work with our former allies to rebuild France"
france.19.t:0 "Marxists offer cooperation"

The proposal outlines a new future for France integrating both our system and the SPF's ideology in a system similar to a more centralized version of Italy's system. While there is great support for this cooperation some of the more radical members of the assembly are worried about increased state control. Refusing the deal is likely to completely destroy our working relationship with the socialist party."
