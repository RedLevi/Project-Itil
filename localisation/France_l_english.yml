france.1.t:0 "The state of France"
france.1.d:0 "The catastrophe that was the great war have left the country weak, devestated and humiliated. Dozens of governments rose and fell since, each failing to restore both food to the people's plates and pride to their hearts. Under the national unity government of 1928 have managed to bring some improvment, only to be cruelly beat down by the world economic crisis. The political instability have radicalized the french people, both to the left and the right, and everyone can feel the result of the 1936 elections would radically transform French society. On the left, the French Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party have formed the French Popular Front with the aim of establishing a left wing state in France, and they are supported by the CGT-UAC labor alliance. On the right, the ruling French Republican Party have formed the anti-socialist National Front with the National Integralist French Popular Leauge. Many reactionary army generals have expressed their open support of the National Front. The streets are tense with hostility and occasional cases of violence between supporters of either faction."
france.1.a:0 "How Unfortunate"
france.2.t:0 "The Right Wing"
france.2.d:0 "The National Front was established as a right wing bulwark against the growing socialist movement , with the relatively new French Popular Leauge joining in with the French Republican Party. There is very little ideological overlap between the new parties, with the French Popular leauge seeking to establish a new order in France based on National-Syndicalist lines according to the teachings of Sorel, with many in the Republican Party decrying the alliance as a betrayel of democracy. Despite these protests, the alliance recieves a wide support from the middle and upper classes, as well as many military officers, including the minister of war Philippe Pétain."
france.2.a:0 "Okay"
france.3.t:0 "The Left Wing"
france.3.d:0 "The French People's Front is a coalition of Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party that wishes to discard liberal capitalism, believing it to be the main driving force that has caused French social-economic collapse following the Great European War, which they believe had been caused by greed of big business and the military-industrial complex in the western great powers. The French Socialist boom has its roots in the ending year of the war, as the Germans had pushed deep into northern France and had reached the outskirts of Paris, with many soldiers mutinying in protest of what they saw as a worthless war that only brought death and destruction upon France and the rest of Europe. The socialist movement enjoys great support among industrial workers in large cities and with rural farmers. The Socialist Party of the movement believes in a France governed by a system of federalized labor councils, while the Social Reform Party believes in reforming capitalism into a more humane system. The movement plans to contend in the 1936 elections, where it is predicted they will attract a big percentage of the electorate. The radical Anarchist-Syndicalist alliance, the CGT-AUC have also endorsed the movement."
