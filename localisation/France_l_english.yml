france.1.t:0 "The state of France"
france.1.d:0 "The catastrophe that was the great war have left the country weak, devestated and humiliated. Dozens of governments rose and fell since, each failing to restore both food to the people's plates and pride to their hearts. Under the national unity government of 1928 have managed to bring some improvment, only to be cruelly beat down by the world economic crisis. The political instability have radicalized the french people, both to the left and the right, and everyone can feel the result of the 1936 elections would radically transform French society. On the left, the French Socialist Party and the Social Reform Party have formed the French Popular Front with the aim of establishing a left wing state in France, and they are supported by the CGT-UAC labor alliance. On the right, the ruling French Republican Party have formed the anti-socialist National Front with the National Integralist French Popular Leauge. Many reactionary army generals have expressed their open support of the National Front. The streets are tense with hostility and occasional cases of violence between supporters of either faction."

There are major differences within the front, with the Socialist Party advocating for a Marxist platform and the establishment of a fourth republic, and the Republican Party wishes to retain the current model. The movement plans to contend in the 1936 elections, where it is predicted they will attract a big percentage of the electorate.
