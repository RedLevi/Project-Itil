The Great War made Germany the strongest on the continent, however, the economy is recovering from the great depression 7 years ago and its rivals, The British Empire to the west and the Communists in Italy and Russia are gaining strength and waiting for the oppurtunity to wipe out our Empire, so we must be ready for the upcoming future."
