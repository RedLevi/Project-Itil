jdom.1.t:0 "The Showa Democracy"
jdom.1.d:0 "The trend of political libralization and the growth of the Japanese Plutocracy that started in the Taisho era have continued well into the Showa era, particularly thanks to the effort of Hamaguchi Osachi and the Minseito who managed to subdue the rise of both militarism and ultranationalism. Thanks to the support of powerful Zaibatsu both at home and in the colonies and the shift in popular opinion the Diet have risen to be the most powerful political body in Japan, with several major political parties hoping to use the coming elections to push through constitutional reforms. The biggest party is the Liberal Minseito under the leadership of Hamaguchi Osachi, which ruled the country since 1930 and proposes to ground the parliamentary system into the Japanese constitution and increase political freedoms even further. The main right wing opposition party are the conservative and nationalist Seiyukai, who wish to transform Japan into a more centralized presidential system. On the left there are two main parties, the Shakai Minshuto, a reformist socialist party wishing to end Zaibatsu influence in Japanese politics and to enact various social and economic reforms, and the Rodonominto, a radical party affilated with the Second International wishing to establish a socialist revolutionary state in Japan. All major parties have been campaigning vigorously for the coming general elections that would take place this summer."
jdom.1.a:0 "I do love a good election"
jdom.2.t:0 "Left wing electoral coalition"
jdom.2.d:0 "Today the leading committees of the Social People's Party (Shakai Minshuto) and the Rodonominto (Labour-Farmer Party) have announced their intention to attempt to create a coalition government  in the coming elections in an effort to pervent a right wing party from winning the critical election. Their platform includes various social, economic and political reforms including the right for collective bargaining, universal suffrage, government regulation on the Zaibatsu and land reform."
jdom.2.a:0 "Interesting..."
jdom.3.t:0 "Japanese general elections of 1936"
jdom.3.d:0 "Today the general elections to the Japanese diet will take place. All Japanese men over the age of 20 are eligable to vote, and a high turnover rate is expected. As in the previous election the emperor will task the chairman of the biggest party to form a new cabinet, and the winning party will be able to pass constitutional reforms. The three main contending parties are the Liberal Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party), the conservative Seiyukai (Constitutional Association of Political Friendship) and the socialist coalition of the Labour-Farmer party and Social People's Party."
jdom.3.a:0 "The Liberal Minseito"
jdom.3.b:0 "The Conservative Seiyukai"
jdom.3.c:0 "The Socialist Coalition"
jdom.4.t:0 "Shakai Minshuto-Rodonominto coalition breaks up"
jdom.4.d:0 "Following the recent electoral failure of the left wing coalition have brought back up ideological differences between the two parties. The coalition have been officially broken up today, with both parties continuing their individual activities"
jdom.4.a:0 "Interesting news"
jdom.5.t:0 "Shakai Minshuto-Rodonominto coalition breaks up"
jdom.5.d:0 "Following recent disagreements within the ruling coalition the division between the Shakai Minshuto and the Rodonominto have grown too large to maintain. The Rodonominto have left the coalition, leaving the Shakai Minshuto unable to field a majority in the Diet. New elections will have to be held to form a new government."
jdom.5.a:0 "Bad news"
jdom.6.t:0 "Major Suffragette rally"
jdom.6.d:0 "Several major feminist groups affiliated with the Socialist movement have held a major rally in front of the diet in Tokyo today. The demonstrators demanded a constitutional ammdendment promising full suffrage to all Japanese citizens, regardless of gender or income. The rally was concluded with a fiery speech by Fusae Ichikawa, a long time feminist activist and was covered eagerly by the media."
jdom.6.a:0 "Interesting development..."
jdom.7.t:0 "Kokuhonsha Rally in Kyoto"
jdom.7.d:0 "The Kokuhonsha movement lead by Hiranuma Kiichiro have held a supporters rally outside of the old imperial palace in Kyoto today. While not particularly large, the nationalist movement has some influential members among the military leadership, buisness elite and old aristocracy. The movement heavily opposes what they see as western degenerecy of Japanese society through ideologies such as Liberalism and Socialism, as well as the growing popularity of western pop culture in Japan."
jdom.7.a:0 "Interesting..."
jdom.8.t:0 "Labor crisis in Osaka"
jdom.8.d:0 "Our progressive labor policies have helped the labor movement to grow to unprecedented heights, and saw marked improvements in working conditions in several major industries. Despite this, many workers, however still struggle to improve their conditions throughout the country. A labor dispute in the Osaka harbor between the management and the workers have turned into a militant strike that threatens to cause massive economic damages to the several local corporations. The government have been called to intervene in this crisis, and immideatly heated debates within the ruling coalition were sparked. The Labour-Farmer Party wants to encourage the workers and formally endorse militant labor activities as a 'preperation for the people's revolution' while the Social People's Party wants to establish a formal government body to aid negotiations between labor unions and corporations. This decision is likely to have far reaching consequences on the political landscape, with each party eager to gain dominance of the diet."
jdom.8.a:0 "Establish the Bureau For Economic Cooperation"
jdom.8.b:0 "Support the militant workers"
