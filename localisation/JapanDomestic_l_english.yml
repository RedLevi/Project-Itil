jdom.1.t:0 "The Showa Democracy"
jdom.1.d:0 "The trend of political libralization and the growth of the Japanese Plutocracy that started in the Taisho era have continued well into the Showa era, particularly thanks to the effort of Hamaguchi Osachi and the Minseito who managed to subdue the rise of both militarism and ultranationalism. Thanks to the support of powerful Zaibatsu both at home and in the colonies and the shift in popular opinion the Diet have risen to be the most powerful political body in Japan, with several major political parties hoping to use the coming elections to push through constitutional reforms. The biggest party is the Liberal Minseito under the leadership of Hamaguchi Osachi, which ruled the country since 1930 and proposes to ground the parliamentary system into the Japanese constitution and increase political freedoms even further. The main right wing opposition party are the conservative and nationalist Seiyukai, who wish to transform Japan into a more centralized presidential system. On the left there are two main parties, the Shakai Minshuto, a reformist socialist party wishing to end Zaibatsu influence in Japanese politics and to enact various social and economic reforms, and the Rodonominto, a radical party affilated with the Second International wishing to establish a socialist revolutionary state in Japan. All major parties have been campaigning vigorously for the coming general elections that would take place this summer."

As in the previous election the emperor will task the chairman of the biggest party to form a new cabinet, and the winning party will be able to pass constitutional reforms.
