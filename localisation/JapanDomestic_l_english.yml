jdom.1.t:0 "The Showa Democracy"
jdom.1.d:0 "The trend of political libralization and the growth of the Japanese Plutocracy that started in the Taisho era have continued well into the Showa era, particularly thanks to the effort of Hamaguchi Osachi and the Minseito who managed to subdue the rise of both militarism and ultranationalism. Thanks to the support of powerful Zaibatsu both at home and in the colonies and the shift in popular opinion the Diet have risen to be the most powerful political body in Japan, with several major political parties hoping to use the coming elections to push through constitutional reforms. The biggest party is the Liberal Minseito under the leadership of Hamaguchi Osachi, which ruled the country since 1930 and proposes to ground the parliamentary system into the Japanese constitution and increase political freedoms even further. The main right wing opposition party are the conservative and nationalist Seiyukai, who wish to transform Japan into a more centralized presidential system. On the left there are two main parties, the Shakai Minshuto, a reformist socialist party wishing to end Zaibatsu influence in Japanese politics and to enact various social and economic reforms, and the Rodonominto, a radical party affilated with the Second International wishing to establish a socialist revolutionary state in Japan. All major parties have been campaigning vigorously for the coming general elections that would take place this summer."
jdom.1.a:0 "I do love a good election"
jdom.2.t:0 "Left wing electoral coalition"
jdom.2.d:0 "Today the leading committees of the Social People's Party (Shakai Minshuto) and the Rodonominto (Labour-Farmer Party) have announced their intention to attempt to create a coalition government  in the coming elections in an effort to pervent a right wing party from winning the critical election. Their platform includes various social, economic and political reforms including the right for collective bargaining, universal suffrage, government regulation on the Zaibatsu and land reform."
jdom.2.a:0 "Interesting..."
jdom.3.t:0 "Japanese general elections of 1936"
jdom.3.d:0 "Today the general elections to the Japanese diet will take place. All Japanese men over the age of 20 are eligable to vote, and a high turnover rate is expected. As in the previous election the emperor will task the chairman of the biggest party to form a new cabinet, and the winning party will be able to pass constitutional reforms. The three main contending parties are the Liberal Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party), the conservative Seiyukai (Constitutional Association of Political Friendship) and the socialist coalition of the Labour-Farmer party and Social People's Party."

jdom.4.d:0 "Following the recent electoral failure of the left wing coalition have brought back up ideological differences between the two parties. The coalition have been officially broken up today, with both parties continuing their individual activities"
jdom.4.a:0 "Interesting news"
jdom.5.t:0 "Shakai Minshuto-Rodonominto coalition breaks up"
jdom.5.d:0 "Following recent disagreements within the ruling coalition the division between the Shakai Minshuto and the Rodonominto have grown too large to maintain. The Rodonominto have left the coalition, leaving the Shakai Minshuto unable to field a majority in the Diet. New elections will have to be held as soon as possible to form a new government."
jdom.5.a:0 "New elections will be held next month"
jdom.6.t:0 "Major Suffragette rally"
jdom.6.d:0 "Several major feminist groups affiliated with the Socialist movement have held a major rally in front of the diet in Tokyo today. The demonstrators demanded a constitutional ammdendment promising full suffrage to all Japanese citizens, regardless of gender or income. The rally was concluded with a fiery speech by Fusae Ichikawa, a long time feminist activist and was covered eagerly by the media."
jdom.6.a:0 "Interesting development..."
jdom.7.t:0 "Kokuhonsha Rally in Kyoto"
jdom.7.d:0 "The Kokuhonsha movement lead by Hiranuma Kiichiro have held a supporters rally outside of the old imperial palace in Kyoto today. While not particularly large, the nationalist movement has some influential members among the military leadership, buisness elite and old aristocracy. The movement heavily opposes what they see as western degenerecy of Japanese society through ideologies such as Liberalism and Socialism, as well as the growing popularity of western pop culture in Japan."
jdom.7.a:0 "Interesting..."
jdom.8.t:0 "Labor crisis in Osaka"
jdom.8.d:0 "Our progressive labor policies have helped the labor movement to grow to unprecedented heights, and saw marked improvements in working conditions in several major industries. Despite this, many workers, however still struggle to improve their conditions throughout the country. A labor dispute in the Osaka harbor between the management and the workers have turned into a militant strike that threatens to cause massive economic damages to the several local corporations. The government have been called to intervene in this crisis, and immideatly heated debates within the ruling coalition were sparked. The Labour-Farmer Party wants to encourage the workers and formally endorse militant labor activities as a 'preperation for the people's revolution' while the Social People's Party wants to establish a formal government body to aid negotiations between labor unions and corporations. This decision is likely to have far reaching consequences on the political landscape, with each party eager to gain dominance of the diet."
jdom.8.a:0 "Establish the Bureau For Economic Cooperation"
jdom.8.b:0 "Support the militant workers"
jdom.9.t:0 "Socialist uprising!"
jdom.9.d:0 "Ever since the government officially endorsed militant labor unions the Rodonominto affiliated Hyogikai labor union and the Nichino tenant union have grown to significant sizes in both rural regions and urban centers. Militant strikes and demonstrations have become more and more frequent, culminating today with a general strike declared by the two organizations, calling all Japanese people to join in the final struggle against capitalism in Japan. The Rodonominto have endoresed the general strike and left the ruling coalition, leading to the collapse of the elected govrnment. Industrial centers and government institutions are being occupied by thousands of workers throughout the home islands, while the colonies remain mostly without incident."
jdom.9.a:0 "Is this the end of Capitalism in Japan?"
jdom.10.t:0 "The Kokuhonsha flees to Manchuria"
jdom.10.d:0 "Following the turmoil in the mainland, many buisnessmen and prominant anti-socialists have fled the home islands to the colonies in outer Manchuria in fear of retrebution from radicalized workers. Today, Hiranuma Kiichiro have arrived in Urajio, announcing the intentions of the Kokuhonsha to 'actively oppose any socialist attempts to destroy the proud Yamato nation...'. Many exiles and ultranationalist officers have have flocked around the Kokuhonsha, and we're quickly losing control over the manchurian territories."
jdom.10.a:0 "We might be headed towards a civil war"
jdom.11.t:0 "Civil war erupts!"
jdom.11.d:0 "This morning militias of radicalized workers affiliated with the Hyogikai have stormed the Diet building in Tokyo and dissolved it. Members of the Rodonominto have declared the establishment of the Japanese Worker's Republic with a new constitutional assembly to be convened after new general elections to the Supreme Soviet of Japan which will take the place of the Diet. Shortly after these announcments the Kokuhonsha, supported by wide sections of the Kuwantang army, have declared war on the new government, leaving much of the continental holdings in their hands. It is expected the Manchurian republic and the Russian state will both soon join the war effort against us."
jdom.11.a:0 "Death to the counterrevolutionaries!"
jdom.12.t:0 "Civil war in Japan"
jdom.12.d:0 "Yesterday the internal peace of the Meiji restoration was finally broken when the red devils have abolished the fledgling Japanese democracy in favor of their ruinous workers' state.

We can combine our armies and crush this communist menace before it spreads to our lands."
jdom.12.a:0 "Join the fight for freedom!"
jdom.13.t:0 "Manchuria joins us!"

jdom.14.a:0 "We will destroy the capitalist pigs!"
jdom.15.t:0 "Civil war in Japan"
jdom.15.d:0 "A few days ago sections of the Japanese army have began an open rebellion against the new socialist government of Japan in an effort to save their country from Communist destruction. The rebel leader have came to us with pleas to help them liberate Japan and join their anti-socialist alliance. Should Japan fall to Communism we will be surrounded on both sides with no one to help us, though some generals have suggested to use this opportunity to retake the Pacific coast from the Japanese."
jdom.15.a:0 "Join the Anti-Socialist alliance"
jdom.15.b:0 "The Japanese be damned. We will regain our lands!"
jdom.16.t:0 "Russia joins us!"
jdom.16.d:0 "The Russians have heeded our calls for assistance and have joined the anti-socialist alliance against the reds!"
jdom.16.a:0 "Excellent!"
jdom.17.t:0 "The Russians join the rebels!"
jdom.17.d:0 "The military leadership of the Russian pretender state have joined the reactionary coalition against us! Unless we call for aid from the second international the rebels are likely to move into Korea and perhaps even the mainland!"

jdom.17.b:0 "We can handle this alone"
jdom.18.t:0 "The Russians attack!"
jdom.18.d:0 "Despite our early expectatins of cooperation the Russians have instead decided to attack us to regain the pacific coast!"
jdom.18.a:0 "Terrible news!"
jdom.19.t:0 "The Russians attack the rebels!"
jdom.19.d:0 "As to be expected from reactionary imperialists, the Russian pretender state have utilized the political turmoil to attack the rebel armies in order to regain their lost territories. We shouldn't expect them to be friendly to us and it might be wise to ask for the help of the second international..."
jdom.20.t:0 "The Japanese call for assistance!"
jdom.20.d:0 "Following a succsesful proletarian revolution on the Japanese home islands bands of reactionary bandits and disgruntled officers have seized eastern siberia and created a so called 'Anti-Socialist Alliance'. The Manchurian lackeys, as well as the traitor Russian state have all joined the fray, and our new comrades in Japan have approached the Second International for assistance in this conflict. This is a precious opportunity to spread socialism to Asia, and to regain our lost lands in Siberia!"
jdom.20.a:0 "We will aid the Japanese workers!"
jdom.20.b:0 "Actually we're busy elsewhere now..."
jdom.21.t:0 "The International joins our struggle!"
jdom.21.d:0 "As part of our negotiation with the Second International we have been granted full membership and have officially joined our war against the rebels in Siberia! They will probably expect the return of their siberian territories in exchange for the help, but this is surely a small price to pay!"
jdom.21.a:0 "Workers of the world unite!"
jdom.22.t:0 "The International refuses!"
jdom.22.d:0 "The Second International have refused to give us military aid in our struggle against the Reactionaries! We stand alone!"
