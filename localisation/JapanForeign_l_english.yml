jfor.1.t:0 "Annexation refferendum for Hawaii?"
jfor.1.d:0 "The leaders of the massive Japanese community of Hawaii have contacted us with a request to pressure the Hawaiian government for an annexation refferendum into the Japanese Empire. The newly independent island nation is both diplomatically and econmically isolated and currently stands defenseless. The Islands are in a very strategic position in the pacific ocean and the already present Japanese population would make annexation relatively easy. Should we go ahead with this refferendum?"
