In the last six years, the Mantetsu have assumed control of the country under the new 'Republic Of Manchuria' and greatly improved both the industry and infrastructure, as well as the general life quality in Manchuria. Internal tensions continue to rise however, as both the Chinese nationalists and leftist agitators oppose Yosuke and the Mantetsu."
man.1.a:0 "Five Races Under One Republic!"
man.2.t:0 "An offer for Russia"
man.2.d:0 "In an effort to improve inter-spherical relations and to increase our profits and influence, some members of the board have suggested buying the Russian section of the Trans-Siberian railway from the Russian State authorities."

man.5.t:0 "Matsuoka Yosuke"
man.5.d:0 "Matsuoka Yosuke was born in the Yamaguchi prefecture in 1880, reciveing education both in America and in Japan. In 1904 Yosuke began his career in the foreign service of Japan where he was eventually posted in China, where he gained influence within the Mantetsu. In 1922 Yosuke joined the Mantetsu board of directors and quickly rose through the ranks of the company. Following the Second Russian Civil War Yosuke intended to return to Japan and pursue a political career, but the rising tensions in Manchuria convinced him to stay in Uraijo, where he helped orchastrate the Japanese invasion in 1930. Following the war Yosuke was promoted to the position of President of Mantetsu, which also gave him de-facto power in the new state of Manchuria. Yosuke established the Kyouwa Yukai party, which essentially serves as the Mantetsu's political wing, with Yosuke as its leader and president of the republic. Using his political and economic control of the country Yosuke began transforming Manchuria into a developed and prosperous nation. The rapid changes to society, and Yosuke's pro-Japanese attitude and his connection to ultra-nationalist groups have caused many tensions with the Chinese population, and his regime have also attracted opposition from left-wing groups protesting the harsh working conditions."

man.6.d:0 "Mamoru Shigemitsu was born in the Oita prefecture in 1887.

Following the Establishment of the Republic Mamoru was appointed to be Japan's ambassador to Manchuria and during his tenure he became involved with liberal reformists, eventually forming the underground 'Reformist Party'. Mamoru's expressed ambitions to liberalize and democratize Manchuria have gained him support from both Chinese moderate nationalists, Japanese urban settlers and the Minseito in Japan. His progressive views gained him many enemies within more nationalist groups, the Kyouwa Yukai cheif among them."
man.7.t:0 "Zhang Jinghui"
man.7.d:0 "Zhang Jinghui was born in Liaoning in 1871, and at a young age Joined Zhang Zoulin's forces. During the first Zhili-Fengtian war Zhang deserted Zoulin's clique and joined the Zhili clique's military force where his experience helped him rise through the ranks. Following the defeat of the Fengtian clique in the northern expedition Zhang was appointed as governer of Harbin and of the  China Eastern Railway Special District in northern Manchuria. After the Japanese invasion in 1930 Zhang was allowed to keep his post under the 'Manchuria Friend-State' treaty, and he soon became the leading figure of the Chinese Nationalist Confederacy in Manchuria, his powerful position protecting him from persecution. Zhang is quite popular among the Chinese population, but his ideology and ambitions make him an unpredictable choice..."

man.12.t:0 "Ethnic tensions"
man.12.d:0 "In recent decades, with the introduction of nationalism the region began to suffer ethnic tensions between the Chinese, Manchurian, Korean and Mongol communities. The situation worsened ever since the Japanese occupation and the establishment of the republic in 1930, as both Japanese settlers and Russian and American emigres have been added to the ethnic mix, particularly in Harbin and Lüshun. If we do not intervene we might see a future uprising against our own regime."

man.16.t:0 "Mantetsu board carries out coup!"
man.16.d:0 "At 07:31 this morning a large explosion could be heard from the presidential residence in Hsinking in an apperant terrorist attack. Troops loyal to the Mantetsu board have taken over the Parliamant, the Hsinking Police HQ and the national broadcasting station in what they claim is an attempt to restore order. Luckily, the president was out of town during the events and was safely escorted by loyal troops to Mukden. It appears that what was surely planned to be a simple coup by the Mantetsu board have turned into a military standoff, with the entire nation holding its breath with dread at which side the Japanese will take."
man.16.a:0 "We must protect democracy!"
man.17.t:0 "Coup in Manchuria"
man.17.d:0 "We have recived urgent communications from our allies in Manchuria, informing us that the Mantetsu board of directors is attempting a military coup in a response to the democratic reforms initiated by the president.

man.20.t:0 "Military coup in Manchuria"
man.20.d:0 "Early this morning an explosion rocked the Manchurian capital of Hsinking as suspected Mantetsu agents attempted to assasinate the president Mamoru Shigemitsu in response to increased democratic reforms. The explosion was followed by a quick takeover of the city by units on the Mantetsu payroll. It is yet to be seen if this coup would mean the end of the democratic process in Manchuria."
man.20.a:0 "Interesting..."
man.21.t:0 "Mantetsu coup crushed!"
man.21.d:0 "We have succsesfuly defeated the Mantetsu backed rebels and arrested their leaders, and a full investigation into Mantetsu activities have been launched. Mantetsu assets are now frozen until further noitce and its board members have been arrested. Yousuke Matsuoka is nowhere to be found though..."
man.21.a:0 "Where could he have gone...?"
man.22.t:0 "Trial of the Mantetsu directors"
man.22.d:0 "Thanks to a thorough investigation, aided by pleas from lesser executives and raids on Mantetsu offices enough evidence was found to convict the Mantetsu board of directors of high treason, conspiracy to murder, bribery and subversion, along with a myriad of other smaller offenses. A speedy trial have found many executives and officers guilty with sentences ranging in severity from capital punishment for officers who participated in the bombing, up to minor prison time for lesser conspirators.

man.23.t:0 "Manchurian State Police"
man.23.d:0 "Today president Mamoru have formally established the Manchurian State Police as the sole legal law-keeping organization in the country.

man.23.a:0 "To protect and serve"
man.24.t:0 "Media criticizes the president!"
man.24.d:0 "Today, the 'Manchuria Daily', a major mantetsu owned newspaper, have published a scathing article aimed against the president Mamoru Shigemitsu. The article is full of damning accusations, surely prompted by Mamoru's reformation efforts. While the claims in the article are entirely ridiculous, it still had a negative effect on Mamoru's image."
man.24.a:0 "They said he eats what?!"
man.25.t:0 "Manchurian film industry"
man.25.d:0 "Today the first Manchurian-made feature film has been released for public screening. The movie, 'Flower Field On The Shore' tells the story of a Japanese IJN sailor deployed in Dalian and his budding romance with a local Chinese university student. The movie has garnered masssive audiences in Manchurian theaters, and has also gained decent popularity in Japan. Meanwhile in China, state censors have made the movie illegal to screen for portraying 'Japanese occupation' in a positive light. The movie is a shining product of both the freedom our people enjoy and our progressive society!"

man.26.t:0 "Leftist protests in Hsinking"
man.26.d:0 "Following the liberalization of politics in manchuria the recently established pro-soviet Social Democratic Party have organized a massive protest in Hsinking today.

man.30.d:0 "The President of Manchuria have announced his intentions to recreate the Co-Prosperity Sphere after the breakup of the Japanese-led political union. The president claims the new union will stand for the protection and promotion of Asian countries and mutual relationships as equals between its members. It is yet to be seen if this attempt is any more sincere or effective than the previous one."
man.30.a:0 "Interesting..."
man.31.t:0 "Recreating the Co-Prosperity Sphere"
man.31.d:0 "Following the collapse of our relations with Japan we have found ourselves diplomatically isolated. We should reestablish the Co-Prosperity Sphere and become a new center for Asian political and cultural affairs."
