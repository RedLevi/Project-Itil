In the last six years, the Mantetsu have assumed control of the country under the new 'Republic Of Manchuria' and greatly improved both the industry and infrastructure, as well as the general life quality in Manchuria. Internal tensions continue to rise however, as both the Chinese nationalists and leftist agitators oppose Yosuke and the Mantetsu."

In 1904 Yosuke began his career in the foreign service of Japan where he was eventually posted in China, where he gained influence within the Mantetsu. In 1922 Yosuke joined the Mantetsu board of directors and quickly rose through the ranks of the company. Following the Second Russian Civil War Yosuke intended to return to Japan and pursue a political career, but the rising tensions in Manchuria convinced him to stay in Uraijo, where he helped orchastrate the Japanese invasion in 1930. Following the war Yosuke was promoted to the position of President of Mantetsu, which also gave him de-facto power in the new state of Manchuria. Yosuke established the Kyouwa Yukai party, which essentially serves as the Mantetsu's political wing, with Yosuke as its leader and president of the republic. Using his political and economic control of the country Yosuke began transforming Manchuria into a developed and prosperous nation. The rapid changes to society, and Yosuke's pro-Japanese attitude and his connection to ultra-nationalist groups have caused many tensions with the Chinese population, and his regime have also attracted opposition from left-wing groups protesting the harsh working conditions."

Mamoru's expressed ambitions to liberalize and democratize Manchuria have gained him support from both Chinese moderate nationalists, Japanese urban settlers and the Minseito in Japan. His progressive views gained him many enemies within more nationalist groups, the Kyouwa Yukai cheif among them."

After the Japanese invasion in 1930 Zhang was allowed to keep his post under the 'Manchuria Friend-State' treaty, and he soon became the leading figure of the Chinese Nationalist Confederacy in Manchuria, his powerful position protecting him from persecution.
