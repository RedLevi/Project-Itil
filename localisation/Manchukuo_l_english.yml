man.1.t:0 "The Republic of Manchuria"
man.1.d:0 "Manchuria have found itself wartorn and famine-stricken throughout most of the early 20th century. The Fengtian clique was defeated by the NRA in 1928, but the Chinese control over the region was short lived, as the Mantetsu board succsesfuly lobbied the Japanese government to intervene in the chaos. by late 1929 Mukden was seized by the advancing Kwantung army, and only Hamaguchi's succsesful intervention prevented an all out war with China. In the last six years, the Mantetsu have assumed control of the country under the new 'Republic Of Manchuria' and greatly improved both the industry and infrastructure, as well as the general life quality in Manchuria. Internal tensions continue to rise however, as both the Chinese nationalists and leftist agitators oppose Yosuke and the Mantetsu."

man.4.a:0 "Perhaps a change of leadership is in order..."
man.5.t:0 "Matsuoka Yosuke"
man.5.d:0 "Matsuoka Yosuke was born in the Yamaguchi prefecture in 1880, reciveing education both in America and in Japan. In 1904 Yosuke began his career in the foreign service of Japan where he was eventually posted in China, where he gained influence within the Mantetsu. In 1922 Yosuke joined the Mantetsu board of directors and quickly rose through the ranks of the company. Following the Second Russian Civil War Yosuke intended to return to Japan and pursue a political career, but the rising tensions in Manchuria convinced him to stay in Uraijo, where he helped orchastrate the Japanese invasion in 1930. Following the war Yosuke was promoted to the position of President of Mantetsu, which also gave him de-facto power in the new state of Manchuria. Yosuke established the Kyouwa Yukai party, which essentially serves as the Mantetsu's political wing, with Yosuke as its leader and president of the republic. Using his political and economic control of the country Yosuke began transforming Manchuria into a developed and prosperous nation. The rapid changes to society, and Yosuke's pro-Japanese attitude and his connection to ultra-nationalist groups have caused many tensions with the Chinese population, and his regime have also attracted opposition from left-wing groups protesting the harsh working conditions."
man.5.a:0 "Interesting..."
man.6.t:0 "Mamoru Shigemitsu"
man.6.d:0 "Mamoru Shigemitsu was born in the Oita prefecture in 1887. After graduating from the Tokyo University Law School Mamoru joined the Japanese foreign service where he took part in numerous foreign delegations in Europe and America. Mamoru was instrumental in brokering the Sino-Japanese peace treaty in 1930 and in facilitating Hamaguchi's succsesful attempt at reigning in the Kwantung army. Following the Establishment of the Republic Mamoru was appointed to be Japan's ambassador to Manchuria and during his tenure he became involved with liberal reformists, eventually forming the underground 'Reformist Party'. Mamoru's expressed ambitions to liberalize and democratize Manchuria have gained him support from both Chinese moderate nationalists, Japanese urban settlers and the Minseito in Japan. His progressive views gained him many enemies within more nationalist groups, the Kyouwa Yukai cheif among them."
man.7.t:0 "Zhang Jinghui"
man.7.d:0 "Zhang Jinghui was born in Liaoning in 1871, and at a young age Joined Zhang Zoulin's forces. During the first Zhili-Fengtian war Zhang deserted Zoulin's clique and joined the Zhili clique's military force where his experience helped him rise through the ranks. Following the defeat of the Fengtian clique in the northern expedition Zhang was appointed as governer of Harbin and of the  China Eastern Railway Special District in northern Manchuria. After the Japanese invasion in 1930 Zhang was allowed to keep his post under the 'Manchuria Friend-State' treaty, and he soon became the leading figure of the Chinese Nationalist Confederacy in Manchuria, his powerful position protecting him from persecution. Zhang is quite popular among the Chinese population, but his ideology and ambitions make him an unpredictable choice..."
