redc.1.t:0 "Shanghai's Workers' Union"
redc.1.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to surpress left-wing activities within our territories, Shanghai have always been a problematic case. Due to both its proximity to the PRF and to its entrenched leftist revolutionary core our campaigns to eradicate the red criminals have been laregley unsuccsesful. Among the red groups operating in the city the 'Shanghai's Workers' Union', affiliated with the Marxist faction of the PRF, is particularly dangerous. This group has thousands of members and affiliates in the industrial areas of the city and often takes part in illegal strikes and demonstrations."

redc.3.t:0 "Shanghai runs red"
redc.3.d:0 "As our police units in Shanghai entered the working class neighborhoods in Shanghai, they were met with surprisingly well armed and well organized militias who managed to fight them off from barricades and factories.

redc.4.d:0 "On the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Xinhai uprising in Shanghai militias loyal to the 'Shanghai's Workers' Union' have rallied the crowds and marched on the city municipality and police headquarters. The local police was quickly beaten back in a short skirmish and the communist agitators have declared their alligence to the PRF to the south. The revolutionary fervour quickly spread to the surrounding towns, and it appears that if we don't intervene we would lose control of the entire province! What should we do?"

redc.6.t:0 "Violence in Shanghai"
redc.6.d:0 "During the celebrations of double ten day in Shanghai a group of workers affiliated with the Communist party have raised their red banners and proclaimed their loyalty to our government.

What should we do?"
