  rus.1.t:0 "The Russian State"
  rus.1.d:0 "The glorious Russian state, born from the fires of the 2nd Russo-Japanese war, aiming to return order and greatness to the Russian homeland, controlled by socialist traitors. Formed out of the White Hundreds, patriots of the homeland that fought against the soviet scourge. We know that liberation is imminent, however the great Russian state has no friends in this world. Our greatest enemy is our closest ally, and if we plan to achieve our goals, we must break the Japanese yoke. Soon, all rightful Russian land will be under our control. Onwards to glory!"
  rus.1.a:0 "Mother Russia is ours!"
  rus.2.t:0 "Manchurian "offer""
  rus.2.d:0 "Today, we recieved a message from the Mantetsu, offering us a considerable sum of money in exchange for the purchase of our part of the Trans-Siberian railway. While both sides can greatly benefit from this, most of the far-right wing of the party are fiercely against this. If we are to accept, we will surely face internal conflict. However if we refuse, it would bring the wrath of Japan down upon us."
  rus.2.a:0 "It is for the greater good"
  rus.2.b:0 "Filthy japs"
