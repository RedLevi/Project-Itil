 soviet.1.t:0 "The Soviet Republic"
 soviet.1.d:0 "The Soviet Republic was formed in the fires of the worldwide social upheaval of the mid-1920s after the devestating 2nd Russian-Japanese war. The Soviet Republic, despite its popularity at home, faces near universal diplomatic isolation, with the Japanese rivals in the east setting up their own pretender regime which is seen as the legitimate Russian government by many capitalist countries. With the death of Lenin in 1928, Leon Trotsky becamethe  leader of the Republic, leading it to rapidly gear towards the perpetual revolution envisioned by Trotsky and the Second International.  Will the workersfinally be able to break their shackles under the guidance of the Soviet Republic?"
 soviet.1.a:0 "Onwards to Revolution!"
 soviet.2.d:0 "The Congress of the Soviet Social Democratic Labour Party is held annualy, with interruptions since 1898. However, since Lenin's new constitution of 1928, the role of the Congress grew from being a small party meeting, to the head decision-making organ of the Soviet Republic. A major issue will be the changes from the 24th Congress, which established the Right's New Economic Policy, a far more isolationist foreign policy, and the stagnation of the Red Army. Trotsky, a major opponent to the 24th congress's changes, wishes to abolish it seeing it as an "oppurtunistic scheme by the Right Opposition in wake of Lenin's death". With Trotsky's massive popularity within the army and mid-party, the chances of success for the right opposition are low. However Kirov, leader of the Centre Opposition has declared his interest in supporting the right. The future of the SDSR will be determined by the 30th congress."
 soviet.2.t:0 "Congress of the SSDLP"
 soviet.2.a:0 "The Future is Uncertain"
 soviet.3.t:0 "The Amendment"
 soviet.3.d:0 "The 24th Congress was arguably the most important since Lenin's death. Major policies were changed, such as implementing the NEP, Army cutbacks, and diplomatic isolation. The soviet high leadership is spilt into two parts, the Left Majority, and the Right Opposition. The Bolsheviks under Trotsky wish to revoke these "revisionist policies" and the Right wants to oust Trotsky's "Reactionary Dictatorship". The Left is expected to get a majority, however Kirov and his Centre Opposition have announced they will consider supporting the Right."
 soviet.3.a:0 "Right Opposition gets the vote!"
 soviet.3.b:0 "Left Majority gets the vote!"
 soviet.4.t:0 "Dissolution of the Right"
 soviet.4.d:0 "2 hours before the vote in the Moscow Central Committee, Kirov was assasinated by an unknown assailant while driving his GAZ-M1 to the prelimenary party meeting to announce his decision. The Right wished to postpone the vote, however the general secretary issued a veto and the vote continiued as normal. Kirov's supporters stuck to the initial plan to cast an all-Left vote. The amendment of the 24th congress was passed with a landslide. Once news broke up that he was killed, suspicion immediatly fell on Trotsky and GPU scheming. Bukharin publicly denounced Trotsky the day after, and was immediatly arrested for false accusations on direct order of Yakov Peters, head of the GPU. Rykov, frightened of being executed escaped to France. The SDSR is now in the hands of Trotsky!"
 soviet.4.a:0 "Down with Revisionists!"
 soviet.5.t:0 "31st Congress of the SSDLP"
 soviet.5.d:0 "The 31st congress of the party is a special congress that will discuss major possible economic and military changes. With the abolishment of the ill-implemented NEP, Trotsky announces he will kickstart the struggling Soviet industry with extremely rapid industrialization, and he will enact major army reforms empowering the major proponents of deep battle, Tukhachevsky and Frunze. However, remnants of the right fervently criticize Trotsky, seeing him as a raging lunatic whose policies will destroy the republic. In the shadows, the GPU is conducting secret trials of Bukharin, and other Right Opposition leaders."
 soviet.5.a:0 "The Future is Bright!"
 soviet.6.t:0 "Rightist Majority"
 soviet.6.d:0 "Despite being assaulted by a deranged gunman on the way, Comrade Kirov of the Centre Opposition reached the preliminary party meeting and has announced his decision to side with the rightists. Thanks to the votes of his supporters, the amendment of the 24th congress has failed. This reveals the loss of power of the left and is seen as many as proof that the Trotskyists no longer constitute a majority of the party. The Republic is on the path of change!"
 soviet.6.a:0 "The madness of the left must be stopped!"
 soviet.7.t:0 "Trotsky is Deposed"
 soviet.7.d:0 "The Centre-Right alliance, having proven it's strength in the previous congress, has moved in to depose Trotsky. In a historic meeting of the party today, the delegates of the opposition have voted together to elect Comrade Kirov to the position of the General Secretary. With an overwhelming majority, Kirov taken control in the Republic!"  
 soviet.7.a:0 "The tyrant has been deposed!"
 soviet.8.t:0 "Trouble in the Party Congress"
 soviet.8.d:0 "Despite the fact that they cooperated to take down Trotsky, the Centre and the Right are troubled partners. The Rightists have accused Kirov of not being committed to their economic plan, and Kirov has dismissed them as revisionists. It seems that with the absence of a common enemy to unite them, their alliance has run it's course."
 soviet.8.a:0 "This conflict must be solved!"
 soviet.9.t:0 "The Struggle for Power"
 soviet.9.d:0 "The end of the 31st Congress has proven that the differences between the Right and the Centre are irreconcilable. The Rightist delegates are now attempting to assume the party leadership from the supporters of Kirov, and take the General Secretariat for one of their leaders, Rykov, but it seems that Kirov has found some allies within the former Trotskyist moderates with promises of a strict economic policy. Who will win this struggle for power and take control of the Republic?"
 soviet.9.a:0 "Comrade Kirov shall purge the revisionists from our ranks!"
 soviet.9.b:0 "The Rightists take control of the party!"
 soviet.10.t:0 "After Kirov's downfall the party was thrown into another power struggle, with both Bukharin and Rykov fighting for the position of party leader."
 soviet.10.a:0 "Bukharin prevails!"
 soviet.10.b:0 "Rykov maintains control!"
 soviet.11.t:0 "Kirov is dead!"
 soviet.11.d:0 "While driving to an undisclosed location, Kirov was brutally murdered by an unknown assassin using a submachine gun. He died 2  hours before a critical vote in the 30th Congress of the SSDLP. Kirov, a member of the Centre opposition was uncertian whether to oppose or support Trotsky, and he was expected to deliver a decision to his party today. Suspicions are falling that this is a Trotskyist plot. The future is Uncertain."
 soviet.11.a:0 "Okay"
 soviet.12.t:0 "Unrest in Mongolia"
 soviet.12.d:0 "In our efforts to make allies in the far east our agents have contacted the Mongolian revolutionary warlord Damdin Sükhbaatar who have long been waging a resistance against the autocratic rule of the Bogd Khanate. Our agents have been supplying Sukhbaatar with weapons and training them in the border regions between Siberia and Tanna Tuva and the revolutionaries are now ready to strike."
 soviet.12.a:0 "Long live the workers' revolution!"
 soviet.13.t:0 "Fate of Mongolia"
 soviet.13.d:0 "The Mongolian revolution was a success, and it is now the time to decide our future relationship with it. Different political factions have debated for creating a puppet regieme in Mongolia, or allowing our new allies full independence. More radical elements in the party center have pushed for a full integration to our republic, but the Mongolian people aren't likely to give up their independence so easily."
 soviet.13.a:0 "Integrate Mongolia!"
 soviet.13.b:0 "Establish a puppet regime"
 soviet.13.c:0 "They shall have full independence!"
 soviet.14.t:0 "Choosing our foreign policy"
 soviet.14.d:0 "As the congress is coming to an end we now have to choose a direction for our foreign policy. The more radical elements of the party center are pushing for more expansionist and hostile actions towards the capitalist nation-states."
 soviet.14.a:0 "World revolution!"
 soviet.14.b:0 "Moderate expansionism!"
 soviet.14.c:0 "Isolation!"
 soviet.15.t:0 "Georgian question"
