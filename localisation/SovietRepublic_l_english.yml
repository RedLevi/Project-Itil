The Soviet Republic, despite its popularity at home, faces near universal diplomatic isolation, with the Japanese rivals in the east setting up their own pretender regime which is seen as the legitimate Russian government by many capitalist countries. With the death of Lenin in 1928, Leon Trotsky becamethe  leader of the Republic, leading it to rapidly gear towards the perpetual revolution envisioned by Trotsky and the Second International.  Will the workersfinally be able to break their shackles under the guidance of the Soviet Republic?"
 soviet.1.a:0 "Long live the revolution!"
 soviet.2.t:0 "All-Soviet Parliamentary Assembly"
 soviet.2.d:0 "The winter seat of the All-Soviet Parliamentary Assembly have opened today, with several factions pushing for different policies. The RSDLP party center lead by Trotsky, the leftist opposition lead by Alexander Shliapnikov in a coalition with other Anarchists, Syndicalists and libertarian Marxists, the right opposition lead by Sergey Kirov and his followers, as well as the People's Reform Coalition of the Russian Union of Liberals and the Socialist Revolutionary Party, who wish to restore the Russian Constitution of 1907. The congress is predicted to be dominated by questions about the nation's economy, political system, national identity and foreign policy."
