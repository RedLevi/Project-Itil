 soviet.1.t:0 "The Soviet Republic"
 soviet.1.d:0 "The Soviet Republic was formed in the fires of the worldwide social upheaval of the mid-1920s after the devestating 2nd Russian-Japanese war. The Soviet Republic, despite its popularity at home, faces near universal diplomatic isolation, with the Japanese rivals in the east setting up their own pretender regime which is seen as the legitimate Russian government by many capitalist countries. With the death of Lenin in 1928, Leon Trotsky becamethe  leader of the Republic, leading it to rapidly gear towards the perpetual revolution envisioned by Trotsky and the Second International.  Will the workersfinally be able to break their shackles under the guidance of the Soviet Republic?"
 soviet.1.a:0 "Onwards to Revolution!"
 soviet.2.d:0 "The Congress of the Soviet Social Democratic Labour Party is held annualy, with interruptions since 1898. However, since Lenin's new constitution of 1928, the role of the Congress grew from being a small party meeting, to the head decision-making organ of the Soviet Republic. A major issue will be the changes from the 24th Congress, which established the Right's New Economic Policy, a far more isolationist foreign policy, and the stagnation of the Red Army. Trotsky, a major opponent to the 24th congress's changes, wishes to abolish it seeing it as an "oppurtunistic scheme by the Right Opposition in wake of Lenin's death". With Trotsky's massive popularity within the army and mid-party, the chances of success for the right opposition are low. However Kirov, leader of the Centre Opposition has declared his interest in supporting the right. The future of the SDSR will be determined by the 30th congress."
 soviet.2.t:0 "Congress of the SSDLP"
 soviet.2.a:0 "The Future is Uncertain"
 soviet.3.t:0 "The Amendment"
 soviet.3.d:0 "The 24th Congress was arguably the most important since Lenin's death. Major policies were changed, such as implementing the NEP, Army cutbacks, and diplomatic isolation. The soviet high leadership is spilt into two parts, the Left Majority, and the Right Opposition. The Bolsheviks under Trotsky wish to revoke these "revisionist policies" and the Right wants to oust Trotsky's "Reactionary Dictatorship". The Left is expected to get a majority, however Kirov and his Centre Opposition have announced they will consider supporting the Right."
 soviet.3.a:0 "Right Opposition gets the vote!"
 soviet.3.b:0 "Left Majority gets the vote!"
 soviet.4.t:0 "Dissolution of the Right"
 soviet.4.d:0 "2 hours before the vote in the Moscow Central Committee, Kirov was assasinated by an unknown assailant while driving his GAZ-M1 to the prelimenary party meeting to announce his decision. The Right wished to postpone the vote, however the general secretary issued a veto and the vote continiued as normal. Kirov's supporters stuck to the initial plan to cast an all-Left vote. The amendment of the 24th congress was passed with a landslide. Once news broke up that he was killed, suspicion immediatly fell on Trotsky and GPU scheming. Bukharin publicly denounced Trotsky the day after, and was immediatly arrested for false accusations on direct order of Yakov Peters, head of the GPU. Rykov, frightened of being executed escaped to France. The SDSR is now in the hands of Trotsky!"
 soviet.4.a:0 "Down with Revisionists!"
 soviet.11.t:0 "Kirov is dead!"
 soviet.11.d:0 "While driving to an undisclosed location, Kirov was brutally murdered by an unknown assassin using a submachine gun. He died 2  hours before a critical vote in the 30th Congress of the SSDLP. Kirov, a member of the Centre opposition was uncertian whether to oppose or support Trotsky, and he was expected to deliver a decision to his party today. Suspicions are falling that this is a Trotskyist plot. The future is Uncertain."
 soviet.11.a:0 "Okay"
 soviet.5.t:0 "31st Congress of the SSDLP"
 soviet.5.d:0 "The 31st congress of the party is a special congress that will discuss major possible economic and military changes. With the abolishment of the ill-implemented NEP, Trotsky announces he will kickstart the struggling Soviet industry with extremely rapid industrialization, and he will enact major army reforms empowering the major proponents of deep battle, Tukhachevsky and Frunze. However, remnants of the right fervently criticize Trotsky, seeing him as a raging lunatic whose policies will destroy the republic. In the shadows, the GPU is conducting secret trials of Bukharin, and other Right Opposition leaders."
 soviet.5.a:0 "The Future is Bright!"
