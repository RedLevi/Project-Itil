engdom.1.t:0 "The Imperial Conference of 1937"
engdom.1.d:0 "Once again it is time for us to gather with our colonial subjects in London and decide the future of the empire. Despite the growth of our sphere of influence in the last decade, our control of the colonies is getting weaker every year, with the rise of nationalist and independence movements. There are three main solutions brought to us by different factions. The conservatives and some right wing members of the liberal party support a federalization process of our dominions. The more mainstream liberals support expanding home rule to all colonial subjects throughout the empire. A fringe group of socialists and left leaning liberals support complete decolonialization and the establishment of a political and military block."
