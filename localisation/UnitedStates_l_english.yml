usa.1.t:0 "Presedential elections of 1936"
usa.1.d:0 "For the first time since the civil war and despite calls to suspend the elections the American people once again set out to celebrate democracy. The unprecedented circumstances have forced the electoral committee to pass reforms to the voting system, particularly the abolishment of the electoral college and the implementation of a more direct electoral system. There are three main candidates this year, the Democratic candidate,the incumbent FDR, who supports an aggressive position against the usurpers to the east, and the continuation of his New Deal reforms. The Republican candidate Hiram Johnson, former governer of California, who supports a more isolationist foreign policy and more liberal economic reforms. The third candidate is 'Upton Sinclair of the United Socialist Party of America' who managed to gain a big support base among the urban population and immigrant communities of the coastal states with his promises of transforming America into a 'Workers' state'. Fierce campaigning have taken place all year and it is clear this election will determine the future of American history."

usa.34.t:0 "Political opposition and the Workers' State"
usa.34.d:0 "While our administration is popular among the working classes and the minority communites, we also have many vocal opponents among the middle and upper portions of society. The old tycoons in particular are vocal and succsesful in attraction attentions against our regime, using their remaining assests in the media and industry to conduct smear campaigns on virtually every move we take.

usa.36.t:0 "Political turmoil in California" 
usa.36.d:0 "Last week the new Socialist administration in California have reformed the United State into a socialist state.

usa.36.a:0 "Annex Alaska! The Americans be damned!"
usa.36.b:0 "Its not worth it"
usa.37.t:0 "Canada annexes Alaska!"

usa.38.t:0 "Hawaii seceds!"
usa.38.d:0 "Recent developments in Hawaii have turned the situation on the islands into a crisis - the local elite have managed to field a small militia and have announced their secession from our rule! Our officials there have all been imprisoned or have defected and we are faced with two options, either accepting their secession, or deploying our army to fight the rebels.

usa.39.t:0 "Hawaii and California go to war"

usa.44.a:0 "They will pay for this..."
usa.45.t:0 "Peace with Japan?"
usa.45.d:0 "Our attempts to pacify Hawaii have completely failed and Japan now occupies many of our pacific bases. There is no way we could possibly win this war now, and continuing the conflict could put our entire country at risk. We could perhaps get the Japanese to agree to peace if we give them control of our Pacific islands"
usa.45.a:0 "Sue for peace"
usa.45.b:0 "No deals with the enemies of the workers!"
usa.46.t:0 "The Americans bow to us"
usa.46.d:0 "Our decisive military achivements in the pacific have made the Americans bow down to us and beg for peace. They are offering us their pacific holdings and bases for peace. This would make us the dominant power in the pacific ocean and extand the range of our operation into the Americas. This is far more than we have hoped for!"
usa.46.a:0 "Agree!"
usa.46.b:0 "We must destroy their dangerous regieme!"
usa.47.t:0 "The Japanese agree!"
usa.47.d:0 "The Japanese have agreed to our peace offer and we now must relinquish control of our pacific holdings to the Japanese."

usa.49.t:0 "Seize American bases?"
usa.49.t:0 "Following the Communist takeover in California the political situation in the pacific have become much more unstable, with Hawaii seceding and the Americans losing their grip on the situation.

usa.49.b:0 "No need to antagonize the Americans"
usa.50.t:0 "Japan seizes pacific bases!"
