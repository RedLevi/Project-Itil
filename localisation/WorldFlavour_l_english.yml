### Opening Event ###
flv.1.t:0 "Ante Rebellum - Version 0.2"
flv.1.d:0 "As the year 1936 dawns, the world is in uncertain peace. In Europe, Germany dominates, with it's highly trained armies and developed infastructure, but complaceny and ignorance threaten the great empire. Britain remains a bastion of liberal democracy, holding together the Commonwealth and the League of Nations, featuring Spain and Portugal, singlehandidly now that France - its once staunch ally - is facing internal strife. On the horizon, however, a new power is striring. The Soviet Republic, led by Leon Trotsky, is emerging as a new world power, though it too has its fair share of internal struggle - and must crush the Japanese backed Russian State still holding out in East Siberia. In the Balkans, a new power is growing - that of Yugoslavia - filling the void that remained after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There is no promise it will remain in one piece, however. \nIn the Americas, a rift has opened. The new American State, formed out of the depths of the Great Depression, is now entered in an uncertain ceasefire with the remanants of the United States of America, holed up on the East Coast and defending both by the Rockies, and the promise of British intervention. \nIn the Asian sphere, Japan leads and increasingly liberal diet, and retains its status as the greatest power of Asia, having beated Russia in the Sino-Japanese conflict years ealier, ruling the seas and possesing a modern armed force. China is split between competing factions, and the emerging victor will certainly be a powerful ally, or foe, to Soviet and Japanese interests in the region."
