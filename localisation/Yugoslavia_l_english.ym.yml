yug.1.t:0 "The Bosnian Question"
yug.1.d:0 "We have decided on a process of decentralisation, and we have released the border zones. Now we must decide on the final step - do we continue decentralisation right down to puppeting Bosnia and changing our name back to Serbia, or do we stop our decentralisation efforts there - greatly hurting our political capital?"
yug.1.a:0 "Yes, we will release Bosnia."
yug.1.b:0 "No, we can't weaken ourselves that much."

YUG_ethnic_question:0 "A Matter of Ethnicities"
YUG_ethnic_question_desc:0 "The problem is with our country - it's lack of unity - boils down to the wide difference in ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. We need to get our heads down and work out a solution, before the ethnic groups attempt to rise up..."
YUG_enhanced_freedoms:0 "Enhanced Freedoms"
YUG_enhanced_freedoms_desc:0 "One of the possible solutions is to release ethnic groups in puppet states. We are, in essence, creating the states we previously conquered, but hopefully they will be more nationalistic and enthusiastic to a local government rather than our glorious one here."
YUG_puppet_borders:0 "Puppet the Borders"
YUG_puppet_borders_desc:0 "The first stage towards fulfilling our chosen path is to create puppet states in the border zones - Croatia and Montenegro."
YUG_bosnian_question:0 "The Bosnian Question"

YUG_dc:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is a divided country. Serbian conquest of Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro during the Austrian civil war led to a great territorial gain for Yugoslavia, but the Serbian monarchy and Serbian-dominated government are having trouble getting the new ethnic groups to enthusiastically enlist to server the Yugoslavian forces. Drastic measures are needed, but the government is divided in how to deal with the problem."
YUG_dc_free:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_free_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. We've decided that things need to change - we shall break up Yugoslavia into puppet states under the central Serbian government - this will hopefully encourage more nationalist participation in our lands, and thus more men in our armies."
