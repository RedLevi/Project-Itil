## Introduction ##
yug.30.t:0 "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia"
yug.30.d:0 "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia cam into being on the 13th of February 1922, following the annexation of Bosnia by Serbia. It proceeded to invade Croatia on the 3rd April, who were already defending a Hungarian attack. Croatia fell quickly, and the new Yugoslav forces initiated both skirmishes against the Hungarians in northern Croatia and partisan groups accross the country - the later often violently conducted by armed Serbian militias. Further border clashes occur between Yugoslav, Hungarian and Austrian troops, but Yugoslavia ultimatley failed to advance into Vojvodina or Slovenia, and only gained the southern part of the Istari peninsula. \nOn the 16th of August 1925, King Alexander agrees on a constitution with his provisional government, making Yugoslavia a unitary monarchy. Nationalist parties, especially the Croatian Peasant Party, gain large support in elections, but ultimately the Radical Party wins through slightly dubious means. Just months before the next elections in 1929, however, a Radical Party parliament member shoots dead two members of the Croatian Peasant Party and wound three further, including the party leader. Huge uprisings in the occupied territories occur, notably in Croatia, and a general strike occurs in these areas. In reaction, King Alexander suspends the constitution on the 6th January 1929, and enters a period of absolute dictatorship that brutally crushes the protests in Croatia. \nOn the 18th of March 1931, King Alexander announces a new constitution - giving the king emergency powers, the ability to appoint half of the upper house and direct control of the military. Any law could be passed with the support of just one of the two houses if the King approved of the law."

## Expansionism ##
# Vojvodina #
yug.16.t:0 "Yugoslvia Offers an Alliance"
yug.16.d:0 "Yugoslav diplomats in Budapest today have passed our diplomats an alliance request. They would like us to enter into a formal alliance with them, including military co-operation. The pretext, they state, is to defend the Balkans against external aggressors and to maintain peace within the Balkans itself. However, it also involves secret protocols to carve up Hungary between the two of us - in the event of war between Yugoslavia and Hungary, we will be called to arms. Once Hungary has been defeated, Northern Transylvania and other ancestral Romanian territories will returned to us, whilst Hungary and Slovakia will be turned into Yugoslavian protectorates. Is this deal satisfactory?"
yug.16.a:0 "Agree to the Pact"
yug.16.b:0 "Politely Decline"
yug.17.t:0 "Yugoslavian demands Vojvodina!"
yug.17.d:0 "The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest has passed us a message from the leadership of Yugoslvia. They have the audacity to demand that we transfer ownership of Vojvodina to them, including Croatian West Vojvodina, or face military action. To empasise their point, they have massed some of their armed forces at the border. Do we appease them, or do we hold our ground?"
yug.17.a:0 "Hand over Vojvodina"
yug.17.b:0 "Refuse their unjust demands!"
yug.18.t:0 "Hungary backs down"
yug.18.d:0 "The message from the Hungarians is clear - they will hand over our rightful territories. We have won this bout, but we have futher business with Hungary. Until then, we can rejoice!"
yug.18.a:0 "Hoorah!"
yug.19.t:0 "Hungary refuses"
yug.19.d:0 "The response we recieved from the Hungarians was not the one we wanted to here, but it was the one we were expecting. Our troops our ready to die for our cause, so let us make it count. All they await is the formal declaration of war."
yug.19.a:0 "To War We Go"
yug.20.t:0 "The Fate of Hungary"
yug.20.d:0 "The time to end Hungary is here. For too long have they been a thorn in our side, but now we are strong enough to put a stop to their nonsence and bring them under out control. Only a few things need to be ironed out, such as do we just puppet a Hungarian state, or weaken it by creating a Slovakian state. Once we have this worked out, we'll just pop a note over to Hungary and hope they'll accept. If not, well, we do have the military ready."
yug.20.a:0 "Return Romania its territories and puppet just Hungary"
yug.20.b:0 "Return Romania its territories and puppet Hungary and Slovakia"
yug.20.c:0 "Just puppet Hungary"
yug.20.e:0 "Puppet both Hungary and Slovakia"
yug.21.t:0 "Yugoslavia demands our obediance!"
yug.21.d:0 "Yugoslavia just can't get enough, apparently. Now they demand that we toe their line completely and fold to whatever territorial and soverinity demands they have. This will almost certainly fatally criple us, but is this the price we must pay to protect our people and live in peace?"
yug.21.a:0 "We must fold"
yug.21.b:0 "No - we will fight!"
yug.22.t:0 "The Hungarian Response"
yug.22.d1:0 "Hungary has foolishly refused to fold to our demands, and instead mobalised their army ready for war. We now must decide to follow through with our threats, for the good of Balkan security, or never be taken seriously again. What must we do?"
yug.22.b:0 "To War!"
yug.22.c:0 "Back Down"
yug.22.d2:0 "Hungary has wisely decided to accept out protection and territorial adjustments that we set out in our recent set of demands. The Yugoslavian embassy in Budapest has temporarily seized control of the state until we can iron out details with the Hungarians over rulership and the like, though this should follow soon enough. Tonight we will party, and extend a warm welcome to our new friends!"
yug.22.a:0 "Hooray!"
yug.23.t:0 "Hungary folds to Yugoslavia"
yug.23.d:0 "Hungary has today decided to fold to demands set out by the Yugoslavian government, including territorial adjustments and Yugoslav overlordship over Hungary. Some experts claim it was inevitable, but others are amazed Hungary went down without a fight."
yug.23.a:0 "We now hold Transylvania. A toast to our Yugoslav friends!"
yug.23.b:0 "New opressors, same situation"
# Slovenia #
yug.24.t:0 "Slovenia Revolts!"
yug.24.d:0 "Nationalist rebels across Slovenia have taken up arms - arms they mysterously didn't have a few months ago - and stormed our government buildings in multiple areas. They demand independence for a Slovene state from Austrian imperialist rule, and want it badly. Possibly worse is the fact that some of the Slovene elements of our armed forces reserves and most of the local Slovenian police forces have declared their allegiance to these rebels. Yugoslavia also appears to back the rebelions, threatening to defend the independence of the Slovenians with force, if neccesary. How shall we react?"
yug.24.a:0 "Deploy our Army!"
yug.24.b:0 "Let them go..."

yug.27.t:0 "Yugoslavia 'politely' asks for Slovenia"
yug.27.d:0 "This morning, the foreign minister for Yugoslavia summoned the Austrian ambassador in Belgrade to his office. Calmly he demanded that Austria transfers ownership of Slovenia to them, so they can properly defend the rights of the Slovenian peoples. At first our ambassador thought him joking, but apparently he was not. Shortly afterwards Yugoslavian divisions began arriving at the border, and have been met with support from the Slovenians in the borderlands. How do we reply?"
yug.27.a:0 "Hand it over"
yug.27.b:0 "We can protect the Slovenes well enough"
yug.28.t:0 "Austria folds"
yug.28.d:0 "In order to avoid a war, Austria has folded. Their military has withdrawn from Istria and Slovenia, and our own has advanced in response. The Slovenian people appear to be enthusiastic about the change of leadership, but only time will tell."
yug.28.a:0 "Rejoice!"
yug.29.t:0 "Austrian Refuses"
yug.29.d:0 "Austria has refused our ultimatum. Some called it inevitable, but we now face a tough choice of tactic. Some of our generals argue for all-out warfare - it would certainly suit us with out military superiority. However, we risk Germany coming to Austria's aid, especially if Austria is in the Imperial Defensive Pact. A second faction amongst our generals is to engage in a limited form of border warfare. This significantly reduces the risk of German intervention, but we would be limited to combat in Istria and Slovenia. Beating the Austrian troops here would probably force a retreat from the areas. There is also, of course, the cowards way out and to back down, but this will surely stifle any future expansionist hopes."
yug.29.a:0 "Full scale warfare"
yug.29.b:0 "Border warfare"
yug.29.c:0 "Back down"

## Elections ##
# Formation of Leftist Coalition #
yug.34.t:0 "The Formation of the Leftist Coalition"
yug.34.d:0 "With the elections of 1939 close at hand, the parties of the left have held a conference. Opinion polls have indicated the Democratic Party has only a small chance of winning the election, especially considering the Price Regent gets to appoint a half of the upper house. The option has therefore been raised that the parties of the left combine together in a grand, leftist coalition to stand a chance of defeating the People's Radical Party. If the plan goes ahead, the leftists themselves won't stand for election, and a unified 'Leftist Coalition' will. Due to the more radical elements in the coalition, in the event of a win more radical policies will be enacted - is this a price the Democratic Party are wlling to pay?"
yug.34.a:0 "The Leftist Coalition forms"
YUG_leftists_form:0 "This means the liberals will not stand for election, and the Leftist Coalition will instead"
yug.34.b:0 "The Democratic Party refuses!"
YUG_no_leftists:0 "The Democratic Party will stand for election by itself, and radical elements will have no chance of getting in to power"
# Election Events #
yug.35.t:0 "The Election of 1939"
yug.35.d:0 "The day of the election has come! Today our peoples, those who are male and of working age, are allowed to come to the polling station to cast their ballot over who they wish to run our glorious country. Previously under King Alexander their vote would not have meant much - he always allocated his half of the upper house to the conservative party of the time, ensuring them a victory. However, now after Alexander's death Prince Paul has signalled a willingness to listen to the votes of the people and appoint his seats relative to that. However, this doesn't mean he has given up the power to assign seats if it so pleases him. Out of the parties standing, only two stand a real chance. Who will the public choose?"
yug.35.a:0 "The People choose the Leftist Coalition"
yug.35.b:0 "The People choose the Democratic Party"
yug.35.c:0 "The People vote for their Radical Party"
yug.36.t:0 "The Prince-Regent assigns his seats"
yug.36.d_left:0 "Following the election, Prince-Regent Paul now has the oppertunity to assign his seats. In the election, the Leftist Coalition, composed of a mixture of liberals, socialists and communists did extraordinarily well, winning the largest share of seats in both houses. Whilst this now means they control the lower house, the Constitution of 1932 means the monarch can assign half of the seats of the upper house, and laws can be passed with the support of the king and only one of the two houses. This effectively means the King has unrestricted legislative power - and his power passes to the Regent in event of a regency. \n \nA decision needs to be made, however. Does Prince-Regent Paul go with public opinion and appoint seats in the same proportion as the ballot - meaning complete Leftist Coalition control of the legislature - or does he appoint seats to Conservative candidates, ensuring continued Conservative control of the country? In the event of the latter, the left will doubtlessly be annoyed and unrest may ensue."
yug.36.d_liberal:0 "Following the election, Prince-Regent Paul now has the oppertunity to assign his seats. In the election, the Liberals did extraordinarily well, winning the largest share of seats in both houses. Whilst this now means they control the lower house, the Constitution of 1932 means the monarch can assign half of the seats of the upper house, and laws can be passed with the support of the king and only one of the two houses.

yug.36.d_conservative:0 "Following the election, Prince-Regent Paul now has the oppertunity to assign his seats.

This effectively means the King has unrestricted legislative power - and his power passes to the Regent in event of a regency. \n \nA Conservative victory is the best case scenario - it means Prince-Regent Paul can assign his seats in a similar proportion to the public votes, which ensures a conservative victory whilst maintaining the outlook that Paul observes the public's view and doesn't wish to intervene in the running of the state."
yug.36.a:0 "Paul goes with the public opinion"
yug.36.b:0 "The Prince appoints conservatives"
## Assasination Events ##
yug.37.t:0 "The Assasination of King Alexander"
yug.37.d:0 "Tragedy has struck! Alexander, our beloved King, has been slain! \nKing Alexander was on his way to hold a speech in the Anti-Socialist summit to dicuss co-operation in the containment of communist expansion in Europe, especially concerning the syndicalist state in Italy and the potential Russian expansion in the Balkans when he was approached by a young man affiliated with the Ustashe, and shot\nThe country is starting to fall into chaos as King Alexander was very much at the centre of the entire beurocracy. Alexander's son, Peter is too young to take up the throne, so Alexander's cousin Paul have been appointed as chief regent. He is expected to declare a state of emergency soon and take swift action to deal with the prevailing problems. The German authorities have handed the assasin and two of his accomplices to us."
yug.37.a:0 "Dark times are ahead"
yug.38.d:0 "Alexander I, king of Yugoslavia, was assasinated today in Munich while attending the Anti-Socialist summit. He was shot whilst entering the conference hall where he was supposed to hold a speech about the spread of Socialism in the Balkans. The Shooter was caught and revealed to have been a member of the Ustashe, a croation nationalist movemnet. The shooter was assisted by two other members and they are all now in the custody of the Yugoslavian authorities. The assasination have caused massive waves in both Germany and Yugoslavia, particularly highlighting ethnic tensions in the latter."
yug.38.a:0 "We mourn"
yug.38.b:0 "On our soil?"
yug.38.c:0 "This may keep them off our backs for a bit"
yug.38.e:0 "Yugoslav weakness is our gain"
yug.38.f:0 "The world is decending the chaos"
yug.39.t:0 "The Trial of The Three"
yug.39.d:0 "Today marks the final day of the Trial of Three - the three member of the Ustashe who perpetrated the assasination of King Alexander, Mijo Kralj, Zvonimir Popišil and Milan Rajić. The weight of evidence means they are inevitably guilty, but the question remains as to what punisment they recieve. Shall it be death, or shall they be imprisoned for life instead?"
yug.39.a:0 "Capital Punishment is only fitting"
yug.39.b:0 "Life Imprisonment is enough"
yug.40.t:0 "King Alexander shot in Munich!"
yug.40.d:0 "King Alexander of Yugoslavia was shot dead today in Munich while attending our summit by a Croatian nationalist posing as a journalist. The summit was called off following the event as security concerns led many attendees to pack their bags. The government is facing severe backlash in the Reichstag  for being unable to protect our guests, and calls for greater political restrictions have been made."
yug.40.a:0 "This is a disaster! "
