## Introduction ##
yug.30.t:0 "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia"
yug.30.d:0 "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia cam into being on the 13th of February 1922, following the annexation of Bosnia by Serbia. It proceeded to invade Croatia on the 3rd April, who were already defending a Hungarian attack. Croatia fell quickly, and the new Yugoslav forces initiated both skirmishes against the Hungarians in northern Croatia and partisan groups accross the country - the later often violently conducted by armed Serbian militias. Further border clashes occur between Yugoslav, Hungarian and Austrian troops, but Yugoslavia ultimatley failed to advance into Vojvodina or Slovenia, and only gained the southern part of the Istari peninsula. \nOn the 16th of August 1925, King Alexander agrees on a constitution with his provisional government, making Yugoslavia a unitary monarchy. Nationalist parties, especially the Croatian Peasant Party, gain large support in elections, but ultimately the Radical Party wins through slightly dubious means. Just months before the next elections in 1929, however, a Radical Party parliament member shoots dead two members of the Croatian Peasant Party and wound three further, including the party leader. Huge uprisings in the occupied territories occur, notably in Croatia, and a general strike occurs in these areas. In reaction, King Alexander suspends the constitution on the 6th January 1929, and enters a period of absolute dictatorship that brutally crushes the protests in Croatia. \nOn the 18th of March 1931, King Alexander announces a new constitution - giving the king emergency powers, the ability to appoint half of the upper house and direct control of the military. Any law could be passed with the support of just one of the two houses if the King approved of the law. \nKing Alexander was assassinate in Marseiller, France on the 9th of October 1934, by a radical nationalistic group. As per his will, Prince Paul took power as the cheif regent for the young Peter II. Prince-Regent Paul has proved more pragmatic that Alexander, and makes significantly less use of the exectutive powers laid out to him in the constitution. This doesn't mean they aren't available, however."

## Question of Ethnicities ##
# Puppeting #
yug.1.t:0 "The Bosnian Question"
yug.1.d:0 "We have decided on a process of decentralisation, and we have released the border zones. Now we must decide on the final step - do we continue decentralisation right down to puppeting Bosnia and changing our name back to Serbia, or do we stop our decentralisation efforts there - greatly hurting our political capital?"
yug.1.a:0 "Yes, we will release Bosnia."
yug.1.b:0 "No, we can't weaken ourselves that much."

yug.16.t:0 "Yugoslvia Offers an Alliance"
yug.16.d:0 "Yugoslav diplomats in Budapest today have passed our diplomats an alliance request. They would like us to enter into a formal alliance with them, including military co-operation. The pretext, they state, is to defend the Balkans against external aggressors and to maintain peace within the Balkans itself. However, it also involves secret protocols to carve up Hungary between the two of us - in the event of war between Yugoslavia and Hungary, we will be called to arms. Once Hungary has been defeated, Northern Transylvania and other ancestral Romanian territories will returned to us, whilst Hungary and Slovakia will be turned into Yugoslavian protectorates. Is this deal satisfactory?"
yug.16.a:0 "Agree to the Pact"
yug.16.b:0 "Politely Decline"
yug.17.t:0 "Yugoslavian demands Vojvodina!"
yug.17.d:0 "The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest has passed us a message from the leadership of Yugoslvia. They have the audacity to demand that we transfer ownership of Vojvodina to them, including Croatian West Vojvodina, or face military action. To empasise their point, they have massed some of their armed forces at the border. Do we appease them, or do we hold our ground?"
yug.17.a:0 "Hand over Vojvodina"
yug.17.b:0 "Refuse their unjust demands!"
yug.18.t:0 "Hungary backs down"
yug.18.d:0 "The message from the Hungarians is clear - they will hand over our rightful territories. We have won this bout, but we have futher business with Hungary. Until then, we can rejoice!"
yug.18.a:0 "Hoorah!"
yug.19.t:0 "Hungary refuses"
yug.19.d:0 "The response we recieved from the Hungarians was not the one we wanted to here, but it was the one we were expecting. Our troops our ready to die for our cause, so let us make it count. All they await is the formal declaration of war."
yug.19.a:0 "To War We Go"
yug.20.t:0 "The Fate of Hungary"
yug.20.d:0 "The time to end Hungary is here. For too long have they been a thorn in our side, but now we are strong enough to put a stop to their nonsence and bring them under out control. Only a few things need to be ironed out, such as do we just puppet a Hungarian state, or weaken it by creating a Slovakian state. Once we have this worked out, we'll just pop a note over to Hungary and hope they'll accept. If not, well, we do have the military ready."
yug.20.a:0 "Return Romania its territories and puppet just Hungary"
yug.20.b:0 "Return Romania its territories and puppet Hungary and Slovakia"
yug.20.c:0 "Just puppet Hungary"
yug.20.e:0 "Puppet both Hungary and Slovakia"
yug.21.t:0 "Yugoslavia demands our obediance!"
yug.21.d:0 "Yugoslavia just can't get enough, apparently. Now they demand that we toe their line completely and fold to whatever territorial and soverinity demands they have. This will almost certainly fatally criple us, but is this the price we must pay to protect our people and live in peace?"
yug.21.a:0 "We must fold"
yug.21.b:0 "No - we will fight!"
yug.22.t:0 "The Hungarian Response"
yug.22.d1:0 "Hungary has foolishly refused to fold to our demands, and instead mobalised their army ready for war. We now must decide to follow through with our threats, for the good of Balkan security, or never be taken seriously again. What must we do?"
yug.22.b:0 "To War!"
yug.22.c:0 "Back Down"
yug.22.d2:0 "Hungary has wisely decided to accept out protection and territorial adjustments that we set out in our recent set of demands. The Yugoslavian embassy in Budapest has temporarily seized control of the state until we can iron out details with the Hungarians over rulership and the like, though this should follow soon enough. Tonight we will party, and extend a warm welcome to our new friends!"
yug.22.a:0 "Hooray!"
yug.23.t:0 "Hungary folds to Yugoslavia"
yug.23.d:0 "Hungary has today decided to fold to demands set out by the Yugoslavian government, including territorial adjustments and Yugoslav overlordship over Hungary. Some experts claim it was inevitable, but others are amazed Hungary went down without a fight."
yug.23.a:0 "We now hold Transylvania. A toast to our Yugoslav friends!"
yug.23.b:0 "New opressors, same situation"
# Slovenia #
yug.24.t:0 "Slovenia Revolts!"
yug.24.d:0 "Nationalist rebels across Slovenia have taken up arms - arms they mysterously didn't have a few months ago - and stormed our government buildings in multiple areas. They demand independence for a Slovene state from Austrian imperialist rule, and want it badly. Possibly worse is the fact that some of the Slovene elements of our armed forces reserves and most of the local Slovenian police forces have declared their allegiance to these rebels. Yugoslavia also appears to back the rebelions, threatening to defend the independence of the Slovenians with force, if neccesary. How shall we react?"
yug.24.a:0 "Deploy our Army!"
yug.24.b:0 "Let them go..."

yug.27.t:0 "Yugoslavia 'politely' asks for Slovenia"
yug.27.d:0 "This morning, the foreign minister for Yugoslavia summoned the Austrian ambassador in Belgrade to his office. Calmly he demanded that Austria transfers ownership of Slovenia to them, so they can properly defend the rights of the Slovenian peoples. At first our ambassador thought him joking, but apparently he was not. Shortly afterwards Yugoslavian divisions began arriving at the border, and have been met with support from the Slovenians in the borderlands. How do we reply?"
yug.27.a:0 "Hand it over"
yug.27.b:0 "We can protect the Slovenes well enough"
yug.28.t:0 "Austria folds"
yug.28.d:0 "In order to avoid a war, Austria has folded. Their military has withdrawn from Istria and Slovenia, and our own has advanced in response. The Slovenian people appear to be enthusiastic about the change of leadership, but only time will tell."
yug.28.a:0 "Rejoice!"
yug.29.t:0 "Austrian Refuses"
yug.29.d:0 "Austria has refused our ultimatum. Some called it inevitable, but we now face a tough choice of tactic. Some of our generals argue for all-out warfare - it would certainly suit us with out military superiority. However, we risk Germany coming to Austria's aid, especially if Austria is in the Imperial Defensive Pact. A second faction amongst our generals is to engage in a limited form of border warfare. This significantly reduces the risk of German intervention, but we would be limited to combat in Istria and Slovenia. Beating the Austrian troops here would probably force a retreat from the areas. There is also, of course, the cowards way out and to back down, but this will surely stifle any future expansionist hopes."
yug.29.a:0 "Full scale warfare"
yug.29.b:0 "Border warfare"
yug.29.c:0 "Back down"

## Ethnic Questions ##
YUG_ethnic_question:0 "A Matter of Ethnicities"
YUG_ethnic_question_desc:0 "The problem is with our country - it's lack of unity - boils down to the wide difference in ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. We need to get our heads down and work out a solution, before the ethnic groups attempt to rise up..."
YUG_look_south:0 "Look South"
YUG_look_south_desc:0 "The first hurdle to cross, regradless of our approach, is Macedonia. Let us bind them to us!"
# Enhanced Freedoms #
YUG_enhanced_freedoms:0 "Enhanced Freedoms"
YUG_enhanced_freedoms_desc:0 "One of the possible solutions is to release ethnic groups in puppet states. We are, in essence, creating the states we previously conquered, but hopefully they will be more nationalistic and enthusiastic to a local government rather than our glorious one here."
YUG_banov_cro:0 "Banovina of Croatia"
YUG_banov_cro_desc:0 "Croatia is the most troublesome of the once-states to exist within our borders. "

YUG_bosnian_question:0 "The Bosnian Question"
YUG_bosnian_question_desc:0 "Now we have created puppet states in Croatia and Montenegro, we must decide on what to do with the Bosnian lands. They are small enough to possibly directly integrate, or we could puppet them as well and declare ourselves the Kingdom of Serbia once again."
# Freedoms / Integration Shared Part #
YUG_rural_inf:0 "Rural Infastructure"
YUG_rural_inf_desc:0 "Building up the existing rural infastructure networks will both help our construction & military deployment, and will also promote support in these areas."
YUG_capital_rail:0 "Trans-Capital Railways"
YUG_capital_rail_desc:0 "An ambitious project to create a railway line has been proposed to link the cities of Zagreb, Sarajevo and Podgorica together. Let's execute it!"
YUG_croat_goods:0 "Croatian Goods"
YUG_croat_goods_desc:0 "To further the integration process, we shall build some factories in Croatian lands. Hopefully the local populaton will think better of us."
YUG_bos_steel:0 "Bosnian Steelworks"
YUG_bos_steel_desc:0 "The industrial districts in Bosnia, especially Sarajevo, are developing well - however, with the right push we can specialise a small number of them to create steel, either from local or imported iron. This should reduce our reliance on foreign goods and increase our capacity to make arms for our men."
YUG_alb_goods:0 "Albanian Factories"
YUG_alb_goods_desc:0 "Albania is the most tricky to deal with, as they were annexed last. Hopefully these factories will be able to push them enough for us to finish our ethnic ambitions."

# Etnic Integration #
YUG_ethnic_int:0 "Ethnic Integration"
YUG_ethnic_int_desc:0 " A second possible solution to the ethnicity problem is in response to the opinion we can't just force our culture on the conquered territories, but equally we can't weaken ourselves by puppeting them. Let us choose the middle ground and attempt to integrate the ethnic groups into one Yugoslavian group."
YUG_bos_focus:0 "Focus on Bosnia"
YUG_bos_focus_desc:0 "The first target for our new integration scheme is Bosnia. The population is both ethnically and historically the closest to the Serbian population that dominates the governemnt, so they should theoretically be the easiest to successfully integrate - however, anything can happen."
YUG_cro_focus:0 "Integrate Croatia"
YUG_cro_focus_desc:0 "Next up on the list is the sizeable Croat population in our nothern lands. They make up significantly more of our total population than the Bosnians, so will be harder to integrate without a hitch. However, using the tactics we have learnt integrating the Bosnians we should have a smooth ride."
YUG_mon_focus:0 "Draw Montenegro Closer"
YUG_mon_focus_desc:0 "Of the heartlands, only one ethnic group remains to be integrated - the Montenegrins. We now have exensive experience behind us, so hopefully we can avoid any unrest and successfully bring Montenegro into the fold."

# Serbian Dominance #
YUG_serbian_dom:0 "Serbian Dominance"
YUG_serbian_dom_desc:0 "Finally, there are some parts of the government that would prefer to retain the elite of all of Yugoslavia as Serbian, in response to the nationalistic threat in our conquered territories. This would probably fire up nationalistic movements in most of, if not all, the occupied territories - but is it a worth price to pay to retain exclusive power?"
YUG_inc_cen:0 "Increased Centralisation"
YUG_inc_cen:0 "Rather than increase the autonomy our borderlands enjoy, we must increase centralisation in reaction to growing ethnic tensions. It is only through this measure we can ensure that we retain power."
YUG_serbify_bos:0 "Serbify Bosnia"
YUG_serbify_bos_desc:0 "We must take decisive action to place Serbian officials incharge of all senior positions in the Bosnian area in order to take effective control of the region. Moreover, we shall enforce Serbian culture on the area, especially in the education sector. Through these measures we can both take control complete control of local industry and have significantly better access to the recruitable populations of Bosnia."
YUG_ser_resources:0 "Serbian Resources"
YUG_ser_resources_desc:0 "We must develop industry in Belgrade to significantly enhance the steel producation process. More steel will make us more guns and bullets - cruitial weapons in putting down any potential revolts!"
YUG_force_cro:0 "Force Croatia into the Fold"
YUG_force_cro_desc:0 "In light of our actions in Bosnia, Croatia has begun to resist our orders. We must again take action, as we did in Bosnia, to ensure our control and access to the local manpower. However, the population is significantly larger, so we anticipate the highest possible resistance to our actions."
YUG_bos_mil_goods:0 "Bosnian Military Goods"
YUG_bos_mil_goods_desc:0 "Now we have seized control, albeit percariously, we should develop the existing military complexes in Bosnia. Barring open revolt, they should be safe from enemy hands."
YUG_crush_mon:0 "Crush Montenegro"
YUG_crush_mon_desc:0 "The final hurdle remains - Montenegro. We must seize total control there as well, and hope they don't get any funny ideas..."
the_yug_line:0 "The Yugoslav Line"
the_yug_line_desc:0 "A series of railway networks must be built so we can swiftly ferry goods and men around the contry in response to any uprisings. Hoepfully this shall ensure our regieme's stability through this potentially troubled time."
YUG_pacify_albania:0 "Pacify Albania"
YUG_pacify_albania_desc:0 "Albania, our most recent conquest, must now recieve the same treatment as the rest of the country. With nationalistic sentiment already running high in Albania, they may be trouble."

YUG_dc:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is a divided country. Serbian conquest of Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro during the Austrian civil war led to a great territorial gain for Yugoslavia, but the Serbian monarchy and Serbian-dominated government are having trouble getting the new ethnic groups to enthusiastically enlist to server the Yugoslavian forces. Drastic measures are needed, but the government is divided in how to deal with the problem."
YUG_dc_free:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_free_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. We've decided that things need to change - we shall break up Yugoslavia into puppet states under the central Serbian government - this will hopefully encourage more nationalist participation in our lands, and thus more men in our armies."
YUG_pragmatic_puppet:0 "A Pragmatic System"
YUG_pragmatic_puppet_desc:0 "Our new system of government has proven extremely adaptable and durable. This is clearly a boon, and our nation will bind together because of this. However, the changes mean the beurocracy has become somewhat cumbersome, hampering our political power from time to time."
YUG_dc_int:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_int_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. We've decided that things need to change - we shall attempt to integrate the ethnic groups into a greater one - Yugoslavian - with the hope that everyone sees themselves as Yugoslavian first and foremost. This will hopefully encourage nationalistic participation."
YUG_suc_int:0 "Successful Integration"
YUG_suc_int_desc:0 "We have successfully integrated the various ethnic groups in Yugoslavia into our country. Whilst it isn't perfect, and our unity still suffers, the people are enthusiastically supporting our rule, and this gives us significantly more political capital to work with."
YUG_dc_dom:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_dom_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. Serbians are clearly the superior ethnic group in Yugoslavia, and as such we will attempt to force Serbian culture on the newly conquered territories and ensure only Serbs have high ranking jobs. This may lead to tensions, however."
YUG_central_benefits:0 "Benefits of Centralisation"
YUG_central_benefits_desc:0 "Serbian dominance has been enforced, and Serbs now occupy all key jobs. This has meant our production mechanism has become highly centralised, enough to bring a number of benefits in construction and consumer production regulation. However, our unity and political capital continue to suffer."
YUG_fourth_option:0 "Promise of a Socialist Slav State"

YUG_executive_power:0 "The Kings's Emergency Powers"
YUG_executive_power_desc:0 "A new constitution was created in 1931, after two years of King Alexander's direct rule. The new constitution gives, amongst other things, emergency powers to the King, his personal appointment of half of the upper house and direct control of the military. Whilst Prince Paul, the Prince Regent for Prince Paul II, has been reluctant to use these provisions, there is no way to say for certain he won't in the face of political instability, or even something he just doesn't like."
