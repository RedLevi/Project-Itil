yug.1.t:0 "The Bosnian Question"
yug.1.d:0 "We have decided on a process of decentralisation, and we have released the border zones. Now we must decide on the final step - do we continue decentralisation right down to puppeting Bosnia and changing our name back to Serbia, or do we stop our decentralisation efforts there - greatly hurting our political capital?"
yug.1.a:0 "Yes, we will release Bosnia."
yug.1.b:0 "No, we can't weaken ourselves that much."

## Ethnic Questions ##
YUG_ethnic_question:0 "A Matter of Ethnicities"
YUG_ethnic_question_desc:0 "The problem is with our country - it's lack of unity - boils down to the wide difference in ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. We need to get our heads down and work out a solution, before the ethnic groups attempt to rise up..."
YUG_look_south:0 "Look South"
YUG_look_south_desc:0 "The first hurdle to cross, regradless of our approach, is Macedonia. Let us bind them to us!"
# Enhanced Freedoms #
YUG_enhanced_freedoms:0 "Enhanced Freedoms"
YUG_enhanced_freedoms_desc:0 "One of the possible solutions is to release ethnic groups in puppet states. We are, in essence, creating the states we previously conquered, but hopefully they will be more nationalistic and enthusiastic to a local government rather than our glorious one here."
YUG_banov_cro:0 "Banovina of Croatia"
YUG_banov_cro_desc:0 "Croatia is the most troublesome of the once-states to exist within our borders. "

YUG_bosnian_question:0 "The Bosnian Question"
YUG_bosnian_question_desc:0 "Now we have created puppet states in Croatia and Montenegro, we must decide on what to do with the Bosnian lands. They are small enough to possibly directly integrate, or we could puppet them as well and declare ourselves the Kingdom of Serbia once again."
# Freedoms / Integration Shared Part #
YUG_rural_inf:0 "Rural Infastructure"
YUG_rural_inf_desc:0 "Building up the existing rural infastructure networks will both help our construction & military deployment, and will also promote support in these areas."
YUG_capital_rail:0 "Trans-Capital Railways"
YUG_capital_rail_desc:0 "An ambitious project to create a railway line has been proposed to link the cities of Zagreb, Sarajevo and Podgorica together. Let's execute it!"
YUG_croat_goods:0 "Croatian Goods"
YUG_croat_goods_desc:0 "To further the integration process, we shall build some factories in Croatian lands. Hopefully the local populaton will think better of us."
YUG_bos_steel:0 "Bosnian Steelworks"
YUG_bos_steel_desc:0 "The industrial districts in Bosnia, especially Sarajevo, are developing well - however, with the right push we can specialise a small number of them to create steel, either from local or imported iron. This should reduce our reliance on foreign goods and increase our capacity to make arms for our men."
YUG_alb_goods:0 "Albanian Factories"
YUG_alb_goods_desc:0 "Albania is the most tricky to deal with, as they were annexed last. Hopefully these factories will be able to push them enough for us to finish our ethnic ambitions."

# Etnic Integration #
YUG_ethnic_int:0 "Ethnic Integration"
YUG_ethnic_int_desc:0 " A second possible solution to the ethnicity problem is in response to the opinion we can't just force our culture on the conquered territories, but equally we can't weaken ourselves by puppeting them. Let us choose the middle ground and attempt to integrate the ethnic groups into one Yugoslavian group."
YUG_bos_focus:0 "Focus on Bosnia"
YUG_bos_focus_desc:0 "The first target for our new integration scheme is Bosnia. The population is both ethnically and historically the closest to the Serbian population that dominates the governemnt, so they should theoretically be the easiest to successfully integrate - however, anything can happen."
YUG_cro_focus:0 "Integrate Croatia"
YUG_cro_focus_desc:0 "Next up on the list is the sizeable Croat population in our nothern lands. They make up significantly more of our total population than the Bosnians, so will be harder to integrate without a hitch. However, using the tactics we have learnt integrating the Bosnians we should have a smooth ride."
YUG_mon_focus:0 "Draw Montenegro Closer"
YUG_mon_focus_desc:0 "Of the heartlands, only one ethnic group remains to be integrated - the Montenegrins. We now have exensive experience behind us, so hopefully we can avoid any unrest and successfully bring Montenegro into the fold."

# Serbian Dominance #
YUG_serbian_dom:0 "Serbian Dominance"
YUG_serbian_dom_desc:0 "Finally, there are some parts of the government that would prefer to retain the elite of all of Yugoslavia as Serbian, in response to the nationalistic threat in our conquered territories. This would probably fire up nationalistic movements in most of, if not all, the occupied territories - but is it a worth price to pay to retain exclusive power?"
YUG_inc_cen:0 "Increased Centralisation"
YUG_inc_cen:0 "Rather than increase the autonomy our borderlands enjoy, we must increase centralisation in reaction to growing ethnic tensions. It is only through this measure we can ensure that we retain power."
YUG_serbify_bos:0 "Serbify Bosnia"
YUG_serbify_bos_desc:0 "We must take decisive action to place Serbian officials incharge of all senior positions in the Bosnian area in order to take effective control of the region. Moreover, we shall enforce Serbian culture on the area, especially in the education sector. Through these measures we can both take control complete control of local industry and have significantly better access to the recruitable populations of Bosnia."
YUG_ser_resources:0 "Serbian Resources"
YUG_ser_resources_desc:0 "We must develop industry in Belgrade to significantly enhance the steel producation process. More steel will make us more guns and bullets - cruitial weapons in putting down any potential revolts!"
YUG_force_cro:0 "Force Croatia into the Fold"
YUG_force_cro_desc:0 "In light of our actions in Bosnia, Croatia has begun to resist our orders. We must again take action, as we did in Bosnia, to ensure our control and access to the local manpower. However, the population is significantly larger, so we anticipate the highest possible resistance to our actions."
YUG_bos_mil_goods:0 "Bosnian Military Goods"
YUG_bos_mil_goods_desc:0 "Now we have seized control, albeit percariously, we should develop the existing military complexes in Bosnia. Barring open revolt, they should be safe from enemy hands."
YUG_crush_mon:0 "Crush Montenegro"
YUG_crush_mon_desc:0 "The final hurdle remains - Montenegro. We must seize total control there as well, and hope they don't get any funny ideas..."
the_yug_line:0 "The Yugoslav Line"
the_yug_line_desc:0 "A series of railway networks must be built so we can swiftly ferry goods and men around the contry in response to any uprisings. Hoepfully this shall ensure our regieme's stability through this potentially troubled time."
YUG_pacify_albania:0 "Pacify Albania"
YUG_pacify_albania_desc:0 "Albania, our most recent conquest, must now recieve the same treatment as the rest of the country. With nationalistic sentiment already running high in Albania, they may be trouble."

YUG_dc:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is a divided country. Serbian conquest of Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro during the Austrian civil war led to a great territorial gain for Yugoslavia, but the Serbian monarchy and Serbian-dominated government are having trouble getting the new ethnic groups to enthusiastically enlist to server the Yugoslavian forces. Drastic measures are needed, but the government is divided in how to deal with the problem."
YUG_dc_free:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_free_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. We've decided that things need to change - we shall break up Yugoslavia into puppet states under the central Serbian government - this will hopefully encourage more nationalist participation in our lands, and thus more men in our armies."
YUG_dc_int:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_int_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. We've decided that things need to change - we shall attempt to integrate the ethnic groups into a greater one - Yugoslavian - with the hope that everyone sees themselves as Yugoslavian first and foremost. This will hopefully encourage nationalistic participation."
YUG_dc_dom:0 "A Divided Country"
YUG_dc_dom_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is still a divided country, but things are improving. Serbians are clearly the superior ethnic group in Yugoslavia, and as such we will attempt to force Serbian culture on the newly conquered territories and ensure only Serbs have high ranking jobs. This may lead to tensions, however."
YUG_fourth_option:0 "Promise of a Socialist Slav State"

YUG_executive_power:0 "The Kings's Emergency Powers"
YUG_executive_power_desc:0 "A new constitution was created in 1931, after two years of King Alexander's direct rule. The new constitution gives, amongst other things, emergency powers to the King, his personal appointment of half of the upper house and direct control of the military. Whilst Prince Paul, the Prince Regent for Prince Paul II, has been reluctant to use these provisions, there is no way to say for certain he won't in the face of political instability, or even something he just doesn't like."
