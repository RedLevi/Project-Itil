##sp3cd's modding setup##

#thought this would be useful for newcomers who don't have the fancy graphical tools and such.

#by the way i'm assuming you have a good enough understanding of modding

#¯\_(ツ)_/¯

##table of contents i guess##
#1 - 36 graphics
#37 - 46 coding in general
#47 - 55 focus trees

#GIMP 2.8.x is probably the best program out there for flags and portraits.
#though, i typically use krita, a different program for flags made from scratch. krita is better for drawing etc.
#GIMP cannot make .dds files (which are required for portraits) but there's a plug-in for that.
#link to GIMP 2.x: https://www.gimp.org/
#link to krita: https://krita.org/en/
#link to .dds file plug-in: http://www.mediafire.com/file/t1e1ca0ecmkpmag/gimp-dds-2.0.9-64bits.zip
##plugin installation instructions##
#once you've unzipped the .zip file, take the dds.exe file and copy-paste it to this directory
#...\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins
#once dds.exe is in there, restart gimp or open it again
#and you're ready to make portraits

#right now, im usuing a program known as atom.
#atom is fast, effective, allows for multiple displays of .txt files at once, and is linked with github.
#so i recommend atom: https://atom.io/
#but if your computer is an actual vegatable then i'd recommend n++
#notepad plus-plus is just a step up from windows notepad
#link to n++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

####focus trees####

#yaaaay it's time
#i use a fan-made software called FETM (focus tree and event manager)
#you'll need to be a registered paradoxplaza user to get to the link
#safe travels, my friend: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/tool-focus-tree-and-event-manager-release-thread.975154/
#although its still very unstable and half of the time its a steaming pile of garbage, it gets work done.
